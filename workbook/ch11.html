<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 11</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Next to incident flux of <em>photosynthetically active (solar)
radiation (PAR)</em>, soil water content is the most important
variable affecting stomatal resistance. Measurements show 
that as the soil dries out the stomatal resistance tends to 
increase, slowly at first and then much more rapidly.  
However, this is about as far as agreement goes in the great
'root-shoot' controversy. Until a few years ago, most texts
on stomatal resistance, such as the one by Jones (1983), 
discussed stomatal resistance in terms of the leaf water 
status, as represented by the leaf (mesophyll) water 
potential. The force of this outpouring of research carried
over into meteorology in those few atmospheric models
whose surface parameterization make explicit reference
to plants, such as the BATS and SiB models. (These models, 
which attempt to describe actual physical processes 
occurring within plants, are <em>mechanistic</em>, as opposed to
those which are satisfied only with bulk formulae in 
which the various coefficients may be determined by curve 
fitting data. Naturally, there are degrees of mechanistic
modeling; one person's mechanism is another's empiricism.) 
</p>
<p>Anyway, something happened in plant research 
around 1985. Some plant scientists found that they
could experimentally induce stomatal changes by 
altering the soil water content only, keeping the 
leaf water potential constant, or by treating the 
roots with the plant hormone ABA. It is difficult to
assess the upheaval in thinking that occurred over 
15 years ago, because the adherents of the root-control
school have been so aggressive and vocal that a large 
minority, if not a majority, of the scientific 
community has been silenced. To speak contrary to the 
new viewpoint, <em>i.e.</em>, to advocate shoot control, is
almost equivalent to supporting a politically incorrect
point of view, such as that the place of women is
only in the kitchen! Like the advocates of this latter
and, we might add, regressive social idea, there 
are still a large number of individuals who secretly 
harbor the reactionary viewpoint of shoot control, 
hoping that it will someday make its return. Alternately
stated, there are still those of us who continue to
believe that leaves—specifically leaf water status—exert a profound influence on stomatal resistance.
In addition, some scientists have looked at flux 
measurements made in the field, and find in these 
measurements strong evidence of a shoot mechanism at 
work. (We refer to the associated phenomenon, to be 
discussed below, as the <em>transpiration plateau</em>.) 
</p>
<p>In this scenario we will investigate the
behavior of stomatal resistance with changing 
soil water content, but we will use a parameterization
that involves linking stomatal resistance directly 
to leaf water potential. It's not that we want to
discredit soil water content, but to show how it 
is possible to calculate stomatal resistance as a 
function of both soil water content and leaf water
status (leaf water potential). You should keep an
open mind as you ponder this scenario. 
</p>

<a name="rootzone"></a>
<h2>Root zone water content and stomatal resistance</h2>


<p>Messages to inhibit stomatal opening are sent from the
roots to the leaves in response to the perception of water 
stress in the root zone. These regulators, which have the
general name of <em>cytokinins</em>, such as ABA (<em>abscisic acid</em>),
are synthesized in the roots and carried through the xylem 
to the stomates. The response time for this communication 
to take place is a few minutes to perhaps hours for a very
large plant. 
</p>  
<p>Virtually all the existing models that relate stomatal 
resistance directly to soil water content employ some 
function of either soil water content or soil water potential.
The functional form of these equations allows stomatal 
resistance to increase as the soil water content is diminished.
At first there is a very small change in stomatal resistance
with decreasing soil water content below field capacity. 
Then, at low soil water content the rate of increase of 
stomatal resistance with decreasing soil water content 
becomes very large. This behavior is shown in Figure 11.1,
which is taken from Turner (1991; his figure 4). Note that 
there is almost no variation in stomatal conductance between 
about 40 and 100 % extractable water in the soil. 
Apparently, stomatal resistance is very weakly related to
soil water content until the latter reaches some value 
well below saturation. This type of threshold behavior in 
plants occurs in other contexts, for example in relation 
to the solar flux (PAR) and to soil hydraulic resistance 
as a function of soil water content
</p>  

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11.gif" alt="figure 11.1"></p>

<p>Let us agree to refer to <em>plant water stress</em> as 
occurring when the stomatal resistance is increased 
(from some reference state) due to a reduction in water 
content in the soil or leaf. (Stress on the plant may 
arise from other factors, such as exposure to ozone, as
discussed in Chapter 13.) An increase in stomatal resistance
that causes an effective shutdown in transpiration defines 
the so-called soil wilting point. As we have begun to see, 
however, internal interaction within the system of different 
factors can mask the effect of a change in just one component.
Conversely, the effect of soil water content on stomatal 
resistance can be indirect, the result of changes in other
factors, such as vapor pressure deficit or solar intensity. 
</p>  
<p>If we let you, you could exercise the formulations that 
links directly root zone water content and stomatal 
resistance via the 'Deardorff' equation, which is an option
in the model. For the present, however, let us move on to 
the leaf water potential response because we believe it to 
be more elegant than the Deardorff equation
</p>  

<a name="leafwater"></a> <h2>Leaf Water Potential and Stomatal Resistance</h2>

<p>Let us return again to Figure 10.2, which shows a schematic 
change in leaf water potential during a week of drying. Although 
the difference between leaf and soil water potentials appear 
almost constant for the first few days, the leaf water potential
appears to crumple against an unseen barrier at about -15 bar.
Now look at Figure 11.2, taken from Nizinski and Saugier (1989;
their figure 2). They show that the measured leaf water potential
of the forest (heavy solid dots) are approximately constant 
along a value of about 0.2 s mm-1 (200 s m-1) until the leaf water
potential reaches a threshold of about  -15 bar, below which the 
stomatal resistance increases rapidly with a further decrease in 
leaf water potential. This is what we examined in the previous 
chapter.  Ultimately, at a leaf water potential of about -25 bar,
the leaf water potential has exceeded the constant value of the 
cuticular resistance (small solid dots).
</p>  
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_004.gif" alt="figure 11.2"></p>

<a name="Transpiration"></a>

<p><strong>The transpiration plateau and the leaf water potential threshold</strong></p>

<p>Measurements showing some sort of leaf water potential 
threshold frequent the literature<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Consider a typical example 
of this which is presented by Turner (1991; his figure 6). 
Many of Turner's earlier papers present dramatic evidence of 
the threshold leaf water potential, yet Turner became a firm 
advocate of soil water control (a root partisan). The presence
of a water potential threshold is markedly visible in Turner's 
data, which we show in Figure 11.3. Note that there is very 
little change in stomatal conductance above a leaf water potential 
of about minus 10 to minus 12 bar, below which there is a 
catastrophic downward plunge in stomatal conductance with 
decreasing leaf water potential. (Recall that stomatal conductance
is simply the inverse of stomatal resistance.) Of course, this
could be the result of an indirect relationship in which the 
roots signal the leaves to shut down. Turner presents both sides 
of the root-shoot issue in his paper but flatly declares that leaf
water potential is not the controlling factor in leaf hydration. 
Some of this problem may be semantics. An underlying factor may be
controlling both the leaf water potential and stomatal 
resistance. Turner suggests that the mechanism is related to
abscisic acid, which comes from the roots. However, he leaves
the door open for the possibility of transient leaf control 
by implying that there might be two sources of stomatal response.
One signal is in the roots and it is carried to the leaves in
response to slow changes in soil water content. Another is in
the leaves, which are also known to produce some abscisic acid; 
this allows for fluctuations in the mesophyll water potential 
(Figure 11.3). 
</p>  
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_002.gif" alt="figure 11.3"></p>

<p>Perhaps a more cogent statement in favor of leaf control
was made by two plant physiologists (Davies and Mansfield, 
1987), whom we quote in the appendix. Note that they say that
a water deficit affects the balance of regulators in the 
leaves. Even if leaf water potential is not in itself the 
mechanism for changing stomatal resistance, both it and the 
stomatal resistance are regulated in tandem by another 
mechanism, <em>e.g</em>. the leaf abscisic acid. In that case our 
viewpoint is less than completely mechanistic, but it is still
circumstantially correct to make stomatal resistance dependent 
on leaf water potential, since modeling the concentration of 
abscissic acid lies well outside the scope of our expertise
or interests. You may draw your own conclusions. 
</p>  

<a name="one"></a>
<p>
1. We have some similar measurements made at Rock 
Springs (Penn State) in a soybean crop. The threshold 
value of leaf water potential for this crop was also 
about -15 bar. More recent measurements by the 
distinguished plant experimentalist at USDA, James Bunce, 
brings new evidence to bear showing that the leaf indeed 
has a voice in controlling stomatal resistance.
</p>


<a name="leafturgor"></a>
<h2>Leaf turgor and wilting</h2>

<p>According to Jones (1983), the onset of wilting, and so 
the threshold water potential, is associated with a vanishing 
of the difference in water potential between the inside and
outside of the mesophyll cells. This difference, which is
generally positive, is called the <em>turgor pressure</em>. (This 
term was introduced in the previous chapter.) You can think 
of turgor pressure of a balloon as that which is keeping it
inflated; so also for the cell. For a given cell solute,
turgor pressure decreases as the total water potential 
decreases, resulting in the cell becoming less and less turgid
with a decrease in its water content. A shrinking of the
mesophyll cells accompanies the loss of turgor, so that 
wilting (the reduction of turgor pressure to zero) manifests
itself as a withering of the plant. Indeed, this shrinkage
is actually reflected by a slight shrinking of  the stem 
width as the plant dries out! </p>

<p>A complete loss of turgor corresponds to a situation of 
distress in the plant. Although some plant scientists discount
the vanishing of turgor pressure as a mechanism for inducing
the increase of stomatal resistance, it is likely that the 
leaf water potential threshold occurs somewhere near that 
point. For many plants zero turgor is reached when the water
potential in the cells is close to -15 bar. Some scientists 
have suggested that, since the stem also shrinks with decreasing 
water content, a measure of stem diameter changes might 
constitute a measure of soil water content. Although many
plants exhibit a stress threshold at values considerably 
less than (more negative than) or greater than (less negative)
-15 bar, the latter figure has been adopted as the official
wilting point. Choice of -15 bar is also due to the fact that
many soils exhibit a very rapid decrease in soil water
potential with decreasing soil water content near -15 bar.
That is the reason why the choice of soil type (and threshold
water potential for the plant) is so important in this model. 
We can see that this value of -15 bar constitutes almost a 
magic number!
 </p> 
<p>Loss of turgor and incipient wilting need not be permanent 
or even associated with a low soil water content. We see 
examples in which the fluxes exhibit a transient response 
to drying soil, suggesting that control of stomatal resistance
also exists in the leaf or is manifested via the leaf. 
Consider Figure 11.4, which shows two evapotranspiration 
curves made over corn, one curve superposed on the other. 
The curves pertain to two adjacent fields, one irrigated 
and wet the other dry; (we are not sure how wet or how dry 
was the soil in each field, but you can certainly tell 
which is which). Note that the two curves are virtually 
identical in the morning and again later in the late
afternoon; in between the one set of fluxes shows a 
distinct flattening. We refer to this flattening as the
<em>transpiration plateau</em>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_003.gif" alt="figure 11.4"></p>


<a name="Transpiration"></a>
<p><strong>Modeling the transpiration plateau</strong></p>
<p>
How does this plateau come about and why is it
transient? Recalling the previous scenario, we note 
that the leaf water potential decreases to a minimum
during midday (in accord with the typical rise and 
fall of transpiration during the day). The leaf water
potential may reach a threshold (<em>e.g.</em> -15 bar),
below which the plant sounds the alarm to close its
stomates. We refer to this threshold as the <em>critical
leaf water potential</em>. Below the threshold, the 
stomatal resistance increases rapidly with a further 
decrease in leaf water potential. That increase in 
stomatal resistance will tend to retard transpiration 
and limit further decrease in leaf water potential. 
</p>
<p>We formulate stomatal resistance as a function of 
leaf water potential. This is done as follows: The 
stomatal resistance function (<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch07.html#equations">Eqn. 7.2</a>) is expressed 
in terms of a component (f(ψ<sub>e</sub>)), where ψ<sub>e</sub> is an 
epidermal leaf water potential, which will be described
shortly. When the leaf water potential lies above the 
imposed threshold leaf water potential, stomatal 
resistance depends weakly on leaf water potential (in
the case of our corn plants, that sensitivity to leaf
water potential is taken to be zero<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>). Below the 
threshold, leaf water potential stomatal resistance 
increases very rapidly with decreasing leaf water
content. We represent each regime<a href="#three"><sup>3</sup></a>, below and above 
threshold by straight lines. The pair of straight lines
defining the sub-threshold and super-threshold regimes
intersects at the point forming a sort of ramp 
function. The point of intersection defines the
threshold leaf water potential. In Figure 11.2: the
two straight lines, one horizontal and one sloping 
upward to the right, intersect to define the threshold 
water potential at -16 bar.  
</p>
<p>Because of the scatter of data it is really 
difficult to determine if stomatal resistance is 
at all sensitive to leaf water potential in the 
sub-threshold regime. Since the data is so limited, 
we arbitrarily chose the slope of the line to be zero
in the sub-threshold regime, as in Figure 11.2 (no
sensitivity of stomatal resistance to leaf water 
potential; you can change these slopes in the model 
in specifying a new vegetation type, but, if you do, 
BEWARE). Beyond the threshold, the slope of the line
is very steep. The most important number in this 
equation is, however, the value of the threshold leaf 
water potential. 
</p>
<a name="leaf"></a>
<p>
<strong>Leaf water potential and vapor pressure deficit</strong>
</p>

<p>
Most plant scientists will concede that <em>if</em> a 
leaf potential tripwire exists, (the alarm mechanism
that signals the arrival of the threshold and zero 
turgor), it lies not in the mesophyll, but in the 
epidermis, specifically in the guard cells. Accordingly, 
we relate the stomatal resistance to the epidermal 
leaf water potential ψ<sub>e</sub> . Now, the mesophyll water 
potential ψ<sub>m</sub> 
governs the transpiration in <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html#equations">Eqn. 10.3</a>,
but the epidermal water potential is the appropriate
potential used in the stomatal resistance equation, 
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch07.html#equations">Eqn. 7.2</a>. Epidermal leaf water potential is similar 
in magnitude to that in the mesophyll, although it 
will always be equal to or lower than the mesophyll
potential. We take the difference between the mesophyll
and epidermal leaf water potential to be proportional
to the vapor pressure deficit. The constant of 
proportionality between mesophyll water potential and 
epidermal water potential is called beta, the parameter
you varied in the last scenario. (Don't worry too 
much about this refinement; it's a brand new approach 
to relating stomatal resistance to vapor pressure 
deficit; some plant scientists actually like the 
idea!) The two potentials can behave somewhat 
independently; the epidermal leaf water potential could 
decrease to the threshold, while the mesophyll leaf water
potential increases, in accordance with a decrease in 
transpiration. (See if this helps you answer the question
from Chapter 10 regarding ψ<sub>e</sub>
and ψ<sub>m</sub>).
</p>
<p>The more conventional way to parameterize the vapor
pressure deficit effect is simply to increase the 
stomatal resistance by some function of the vapor pressure
deficit. This is the basis for the so-called 'Jarvis'
formulation, which is basically the form of the stomatal 
resistance equation used in our model, except, of course, 
for the VPD effect. Although the two methods for augmenting 
the stomatal resistance as a function of vapor pressure 
deficit are fundamentally different they tend to produce 
a similar effect when viewed overall. The problem with the
vapor pressure deficit effect is that it tends to mask the 
water potential threshold effect by accomplishing the same 
thing: an increase in stomatal resistance during the middle 
part of the day, although somewhat skewed toward later afternoon. 
</p>

<a name="potential"></a>
<p>
<strong>Leaf water potential and transpiration</strong>
</p>

<p>
As formulated, the stomatal resistance should not vary
with leaf water potential or with soil water content until
the epidermal leaf water potential reaches the threshold 
value. Imposing a threshold leaf water potential in the 
model leads to a midday increase in stomatal resistance when
the transpiration becomes sufficiently large to require the
leaf water potential to fall to the threshold. (A large 
vapor pressure deficit may also cause the leaf water potential
to reach threshold much sooner, according to our formulation.)
When this happens, the transpiration starts to be arrested 
but, at the same time, the rise in sensible heat flux from
the leaf and the concomitant rise in leaf temperature work 
to augment the transpiration flux (by increasing the vapor
pressure deficit). The result of this tug of war is that
the transpiration neither falls nor rises, but forms a
plateau. The lower the soil water content, the more quickly
in the morning the leaf water potential reaches the plateau
and the longer the plateau lasts. Look at your results from
Chapter 9;  this is also the feedback mechanism we were
discussing.
</p>
<p>Note that the leaf water potential may not reach the
threshold value if the soil is sufficiently wet, because 
it starts out from a relatively small negative value. In that 
case no soil water effect will be observed in the simulations.
The same thing may happen if the sky is cloudy and the 
atmospheric demand for transpiration is weak, because then the
leaf water potential will not fall very far in the absence of 
strong transpiration demand. Alternately, the leaf water 
potential may reach the threshold after starting out at a 
relatively small negative value because the demand for 
transpiration is large, the vapor pressure deficit large or 
for other reasons, <em>e.g.</em>, because the denominator of <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html#equations">Eqn. 
10.2</a> is large for some reason; (<em>e.g.</em> Z<sub>p</sub> is large).
</p>
<p>You may have found in your previous simulations that
stomatal resistance and transpiration do not vary greatly
as a function of soil moisture content over a range of 
soil moisture values, although  xylem resistance and 
other factors (such as ambient relative humidity) influence
the behavior of stomatal resistance. When the water 
potential threshold is reached, however, large fluctuations
in stomatal resistance occur. The earlier the onset of 
the plateau the lower the transpiration during the plateau
and the higher the midday stomatal resistance. As 
suggested by <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html">Figure 10.2</a>, the stomatal resistance and the 
transpiration may not change very much from one day to the
next during soil drying until the threshold is reached.
After that, however, and until a general collapse of the
plant occurs (permanent wilting), the changes are 
primarily during the period of the plateau. 
</p>


<a name="final"></a>
<p>
<strong>A final word on the root-shoot controversy</strong>
</p>

<p>As in many such controversies the solution lies somewhere
between the extremes. In all probability, both root and 
shoot influence the stomatal resistance. According to a 
French scientist named Tardieu, the real mechanism goes 
something like this: As the soil dries out cytokinins 
(ABA) are sent to the leaves. When the leaf begins to 
perceive a water loss stomatal resistance is increased 
and more ABA is produced, including in the leaves 
themselves. The effect of this hormone is to accentuate 
the response of the leaf to stress. The root secretions
augment the effect of the threshold, although without 
affecting the stomatal resistance very much before the 
threshold is reached. As the root continues to dry out 
the change in stomatal resistance with decreasing leaf
water potential is enhanced, resulting in a more rapid
increase in stomatal resistance with decreasing leaf 
water potential. Tardieu's solution incorporates elements
of both arguments but preserves the threshold effect.</p>



<a name="values"></a>
<p>
<strong>Values of threshold leaf water potential</strong>
</p>

<p>Values of threshold leaf water potentials vary with
species, age and previous stress episodes experienced
by the plant<a href="#four"><sup>4</sup></a>. Many plants exhibit a threshold close 
to -15 bar (that magic number again ! ), although values 
vary between -9 and -22 bar depending on the species of
plant. We set the threshold at -15 bar in our 'corn' 
simulations. </p>


<a name="two"></a>
<p>
2. That the sensitivity is weak in corn when the leaf
water potential has not yet reached the threshold is
evidenced by the fact that field measurements tend 
to show no significant differences in fluxes from one
day to the next before the threshold is reached but
a considerable difference after the leaf water potential
threshold is reached. An example of this effect is 
shown in Figure 11.4. 
Note that the two fluxes are essentially 
identical except during the period of the transpiration 
plateau for the dry field. This is a form of transient
water stress.
</p>

<a name="three"></a>
<p>3. The simplest possible function to represent an 
exponential consistent with a minimum of data is a 
pair of straight lines which intersect at the point 
where the exponential increase becomes large. This 
type of equation is sometimes called a 'linear 
discontinuous model'. </p>

<a name="four"></a>
<p>4. Evidence suggests that the threshold leaf water 
potential may decrease (become more negative) with 
repeated episodes of soil drying and water stress 
on the plant. This is a form of adaptation. </p>


<a name="interaction"> </a><h2>Interaction between various parameters and threshold leaf water potential</h2>

<p>1) Soil water content
Stomatal resistance does not vary with soil water content
until the threshold leaf water potential is reached. As 
the soil dries out (Figure 10.2), the soil water potential 
diminishes, requiring the leaf water potential to fall to 
lower and lower values each day in order to sustain the
transpiration. After a while, the soil water potential has
decreased sufficiently to allow the leaf water potential to 
reach the threshold, at least for a short time during the 
day; hence the plateau. Soils that dry out rapidly, such as 
sand, will experience a rapid decrease in soil water potential
and therefore cause the vegetation to reach water stress more
quickly. (What do you suppose would occur if you planted a 
vegetable such as potatoes with a threshold leaf water 
potential of -10 bar in sandy soil, which has a field capacity
of about 10% by volume ?) 
</p>
<p>2) Xylem resistance
Making the xylem resistance larger requires the leaf 
water potential to fall to lower values in order to 
maintain the same transpiration. Thus, the leaf water 
potential is more easily reached under moist soil conditions 
when the xylem resistance is large. 
</p>
<p>3) Vapor pressure deficit
The drier the atmospheric conditions, the greater the
vapor pressure deficit, the larger (initially) the
transpiration and so, the lower the leaf water potential;
the lower the leaf potential the more likely that it 
will reach threshold. Since the tripwire in our model 
resides in the epidermal leaf water potential, the 
larger the value of beta the more likely the leaf will 
reach this potential threshold. (Could this response
be a self-protective behavior against drought ? ) 
</p>
<p>4) Solar intensity
Weak sunshine will require small transpiration and
so, is not likely to cause the leaf water potential
to reach threshold unless the soil is very dry. High 
solar intensity will tend to force a larger 
transpiration and so, cause a lower leaf water 
potential to be reached, all other things being equal. 
</p>


<a name="simulations"> </a><h2>Simulations</h2>
<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>Here, we will allow you to make up your own mind on 
the 'root-shoot' controversy by performing a number of 
sensitivity simulations.  Keep an open mind and try and
determine as many mechanistic relationships as you can
from the output.
</p>
<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>
<p><strong>Vary the soil water content</strong></p>

<p>Run the standard summertime corn case, then lower 
the soil water content enough so that the plateau 
appears in the transpiration. Note the variation in 
leaf water potential and stomatal resistance during the 
period of the plateau, as well as the leaf temperature.
Plot soil water content versus stomatal resistance (at 
midday) for three or four values of soil water content 
and see if your graph resembles Figure 11.1. (Be careful, 
if you lower the soil water content too far you may burn
up the plant and cause the model to behave badly.) </p>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>
<strong>Vary the xylem resistance, Z<sub>p</sub></strong>

<p>Induce the plateau by varying the xylem resistance,
Z<sub>p</sub>. What change in Z<sub>p</sub> will bring on the plateau earlier,
an increase or a decrease?  Plot Z<sub>p</sub> versus stomatal
resistance at midday for three or four different values
of Z<sub>p</sub>.  How sensitive is the leaf water potential, 
transpiration, and stomatal resistance to this factor? 
What happens when you lower the xylem resistance?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the effect of ozone 
deposition on plants, ozone being a toxic gas for tissue, 
is to cause Z<sub>p</sub> to increase; (see Chapter 13). Given this 
fact and your results here, consider what effects atmospheric
concentration of this toxic gas has on plant growth. </p>

<a name="L1S3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 3</em></p>
<p><strong>Vary the beta parameter</strong></p>

<p>Increase beta, (as in a previous scenario) and 
pretend that the corn is somehow sensitive to changes
in vapor pressure deficit. Report on the behavior of
the transpiration plateau and the daily variation of 
stomatal resistance. Also, look closely at the changes 
in leaf and epidermal water potentials as beta is 
varied.  Which of these potentials appears to be the 
'controller' of stomatal resistance based on these 
simulations? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Suppose that the continuation of water stress
would cause the critical leaf water potential to 
decrease. What effect would this change have on transpiration.</li>
<li>If the xylem resistance (Z<sub>p</sub>) increases
with plant age what effect would this have on transpiration?</li>
<li>Why do you suppose that the leaf water potential
does not decrease very far beyond the critical water
potential threshold in any of these simulations?</li>
<li>Why do you suppose the transpiration is 
almost identical in these simulation prior to and 
after the transpiration plateau?</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be obvious that there is no clear winner
to the 'root-shoot' debate, and that there are many 
interactions and influential variables when it comes 
to stomatal closure and transpiration.  The fact that 
soil water content was not varied in simulations 2 and
3 should tell you that root control is not the sole 
answer, and that stomates respond to what the leaf status
is as well.  Just peer out of the closest window and
you will see a multitude of variations of plant types
and sizes.  Thus far, we have considered a full, dense 
plant canopy with maximum solar radiation.  Do you
think a plant growing on its own, without the aid of 
a buffered canopy, might respond differently to the
stresses examined in these simulations?</p>

<p>Try setting up a sparse corn canopy (lower 
the fractional vegetation cover and/or the LAI), 
submitting it to the changes in VPD, xylem resistance,
and soil water content just performed.  Does it 
appear that plants who are 'loners' have extra 
sensitivity to certain changes than those nestled 
in a large canopy do?  Compare to your results from
simulations 1-3 to see which type of plants are 
better off under certain conditions.  Might you have
any recommendations for the future evolution of 
plants who are out on their own to enable them to 
survive longer?</p>

<p>Slowly decrease soil water content in a series of steps 
from field capacity to something like 0.3 of field capacity,
or at least until the stomatal resistance begins to 
rise markedly. Plot soil water content versus mid day 
stomatal resistance. Imagine yourself fitting some
polynomial function to the curve you just obtained.
Argue whether this function would be easier to use 
in a land surface model to calculate stomatal resistance
as a function of soil water content than having to 
formulate the entire plant hydaulics as in our model. </p>

<h2>Appendix</h2>

<p>We have appreciated for some time how wide a range of 
environmental factors can elicit a response from a single 
pair of cells, but to date much research on plant water 
deficits has concentrated upon characterization of the effects
of a deficit-induced increase in a single inhibitor of stomatal
opening, namely, ABA. It now seems likely that water deficit 
may also reduce the concentration in the leaves of promoters of 
stomatal opening, and thus it is more realistic to expect that
the balance of regulators in the leaves will help to determine
the degree of stomatal opening. Stomatal behavior in different
species under varying environmental conditions must be interpreted
in terms of variation in one or more components of an interactive 
system linking external and endogenous factors. Changes in the 
levels of single components may or may not elicit a response, and 
the interactive system operates so that a change in a single 
component may be promotive or inhibitive, depending on the prevailing
conditions. </p>

<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 11</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> 
<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Next to incident flux of <em>photosynthetically active (solar)
radiation (PAR)</em>, soil water content is the most important
variable affecting stomatal resistance. Measurements show 
that as the soil dries out the stomatal resistance tends to 
increase, slowly at first and then much more rapidly.  
However, this is about as far as agreement goes in the great
'root-shoot' controversy. Until a few years ago, most texts
on stomatal resistance, such as the one by Jones (1983), 
discussed stomatal resistance in terms of the leaf water 
status, as represented by the leaf (mesophyll) water 
potential. The force of this outpouring of research carried
over into meteorology in those few atmospheric models
whose surface parameterization make explicit reference
to plants, such as the BATS and SiB models. (These models, 
which attempt to describe actual physical processes 
occurring within plants, are <em>mechanistic</em>, as opposed to
those which are satisfied only with bulk formulae in 
which the various coefficients may be determined by curve 
fitting data. Naturally, there are degrees of mechanistic
modeling; one person's mechanism is another's empiricism.) 
</p>
<p>Anyway, something happened in plant research 
around 1985. Some plant scientists found that they
could experimentally induce stomatal changes by 
altering the soil water content only, keeping the 
leaf water potential constant, or by treating the 
roots with the plant hormone ABA. It is difficult to
assess the upheaval in thinking that occurred over 
15 years ago, because the adherents of the root-control
school have been so aggressive and vocal that a large 
minority, if not a majority, of the scientific 
community has been silenced. To speak contrary to the 
new viewpoint, <em>i.e.</em>, to advocate shoot control, is
almost equivalent to supporting a politically incorrect
point of view, such as that the place of women is
only in the kitchen! Like the advocates of this latter
and, we might add, regressive social idea, there 
are still a large number of individuals who secretly 
harbor the reactionary viewpoint of shoot control, 
hoping that it will someday make its return. Alternately
stated, there are still those of us who continue to
believe that leaves—specifically leaf water status—exert a profound influence on stomatal resistance.
In addition, some scientists have looked at flux 
measurements made in the field, and find in these 
measurements strong evidence of a shoot mechanism at 
work. (We refer to the associated phenomenon, to be 
discussed below, as the <em>transpiration plateau</em>.) 
</p>
<p>In this scenario we will investigate the
behavior of stomatal resistance with changing 
soil water content, but we will use a parameterization
that involves linking stomatal resistance directly 
to leaf water potential. It's not that we want to
discredit soil water content, but to show how it 
is possible to calculate stomatal resistance as a 
function of both soil water content and leaf water
status (leaf water potential). You should keep an
open mind as you ponder this scenario. 
</p>

<a name="rootzone"></a>
<h2>Root zone water content and stomatal resistance</h2>


<p>Messages to inhibit stomatal opening are sent from the
roots to the leaves in response to the perception of water 
stress in the root zone. These regulators, which have the
general name of <em>cytokinins</em>, such as ABA (<em>abscisic acid</em>),
are synthesized in the roots and carried through the xylem 
to the stomates. The response time for this communication 
to take place is a few minutes to perhaps hours for a very
large plant. 
</p>  
<p>Virtually all the existing models that relate stomatal 
resistance directly to soil water content employ some 
function of either soil water content or soil water potential.
The functional form of these equations allows stomatal 
resistance to increase as the soil water content is diminished.
At first there is a very small change in stomatal resistance
with decreasing soil water content below field capacity. 
Then, at low soil water content the rate of increase of 
stomatal resistance with decreasing soil water content 
becomes very large. This behavior is shown in Figure 11.1,
which is taken from Turner (1991; his figure 4). Note that 
there is almost no variation in stomatal conductance between 
about 40 and 100 % extractable water in the soil. 
Apparently, stomatal resistance is very weakly related to
soil water content until the latter reaches some value 
well below saturation. This type of threshold behavior in 
plants occurs in other contexts, for example in relation 
to the solar flux (PAR) and to soil hydraulic resistance 
as a function of soil water content
</p>  

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11.gif" alt="figure 11.1"></p>

<p>Let us agree to refer to <em>plant water stress</em> as 
occurring when the stomatal resistance is increased 
(from some reference state) due to a reduction in water 
content in the soil or leaf. (Stress on the plant may 
arise from other factors, such as exposure to ozone, as
discussed in Chapter 13.) An increase in stomatal resistance
that causes an effective shutdown in transpiration defines 
the so-called soil wilting point. As we have begun to see, 
however, internal interaction within the system of different 
factors can mask the effect of a change in just one component.
Conversely, the effect of soil water content on stomatal 
resistance can be indirect, the result of changes in other
factors, such as vapor pressure deficit or solar intensity. 
</p>  
<p>If we let you, you could exercise the formulations that 
links directly root zone water content and stomatal 
resistance via the 'Deardorff' equation, which is an option
in the model. For the present, however, let us move on to 
the leaf water potential response because we believe it to 
be more elegant than the Deardorff equation
</p>  

<a name="leafwater"></a> <h2>Leaf Water Potential and Stomatal Resistance</h2>

<p>Let us return again to Figure 10.2, which shows a schematic 
change in leaf water potential during a week of drying. Although 
the difference between leaf and soil water potentials appear 
almost constant for the first few days, the leaf water potential
appears to crumple against an unseen barrier at about -15 bar.
Now look at Figure 11.2, taken from Nizinski and Saugier (1989;
their figure 2). They show that the measured leaf water potential
of the forest (heavy solid dots) are approximately constant 
along a value of about 0.2 s mm-1 (200 s m-1) until the leaf water
potential reaches a threshold of about  -15 bar, below which the 
stomatal resistance increases rapidly with a further decrease in 
leaf water potential. This is what we examined in the previous 
chapter.  Ultimately, at a leaf water potential of about -25 bar,
the leaf water potential has exceeded the constant value of the 
cuticular resistance (small solid dots).
</p>  
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_004.gif" alt="figure 11.2"></p>

<a name="Transpiration"></a>

<p><strong>The transpiration plateau and the leaf water potential threshold</strong></p>

<p>Measurements showing some sort of leaf water potential 
threshold frequent the literature<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>.  Consider a typical example 
of this which is presented by Turner (1991; his figure 6). 
Many of Turner's earlier papers present dramatic evidence of 
the threshold leaf water potential, yet Turner became a firm 
advocate of soil water control (a root partisan). The presence
of a water potential threshold is markedly visible in Turner's 
data, which we show in Figure 11.3. Note that there is very 
little change in stomatal conductance above a leaf water potential 
of about minus 10 to minus 12 bar, below which there is a 
catastrophic downward plunge in stomatal conductance with 
decreasing leaf water potential. (Recall that stomatal conductance
is simply the inverse of stomatal resistance.) Of course, this
could be the result of an indirect relationship in which the 
roots signal the leaves to shut down. Turner presents both sides 
of the root-shoot issue in his paper but flatly declares that leaf
water potential is not the controlling factor in leaf hydration. 
Some of this problem may be semantics. An underlying factor may be
controlling both the leaf water potential and stomatal 
resistance. Turner suggests that the mechanism is related to
abscisic acid, which comes from the roots. However, he leaves
the door open for the possibility of transient leaf control 
by implying that there might be two sources of stomatal response.
One signal is in the roots and it is carried to the leaves in
response to slow changes in soil water content. Another is in
the leaves, which are also known to produce some abscisic acid; 
this allows for fluctuations in the mesophyll water potential 
(Figure 11.3). 
</p>  
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_002.gif" alt="figure 11.3"></p>

<p>Perhaps a more cogent statement in favor of leaf control
was made by two plant physiologists (Davies and Mansfield, 
1987), whom we quote in the appendix. Note that they say that
a water deficit affects the balance of regulators in the 
leaves. Even if leaf water potential is not in itself the 
mechanism for changing stomatal resistance, both it and the 
stomatal resistance are regulated in tandem by another 
mechanism, <em>e.g</em>. the leaf abscisic acid. In that case our 
viewpoint is less than completely mechanistic, but it is still
circumstantially correct to make stomatal resistance dependent 
on leaf water potential, since modeling the concentration of 
abscissic acid lies well outside the scope of our expertise
or interests. You may draw your own conclusions. 
</p>  

<a name="one"></a>
<p>
1. We have some similar measurements made at Rock 
Springs (Penn State) in a soybean crop. The threshold 
value of leaf water potential for this crop was also 
about -15 bar. More recent measurements by the 
distinguished plant experimentalist at USDA, James Bunce, 
brings new evidence to bear showing that the leaf indeed 
has a voice in controlling stomatal resistance.
</p>


<a name="leafturgor"></a>
<h2>Leaf turgor and wilting</h2>

<p>According to Jones (1983), the onset of wilting, and so 
the threshold water potential, is associated with a vanishing 
of the difference in water potential between the inside and
outside of the mesophyll cells. This difference, which is
generally positive, is called the <em>turgor pressure</em>. (This 
term was introduced in the previous chapter.) You can think 
of turgor pressure of a balloon as that which is keeping it
inflated; so also for the cell. For a given cell solute,
turgor pressure decreases as the total water potential 
decreases, resulting in the cell becoming less and less turgid
with a decrease in its water content. A shrinking of the
mesophyll cells accompanies the loss of turgor, so that 
wilting (the reduction of turgor pressure to zero) manifests
itself as a withering of the plant. Indeed, this shrinkage
is actually reflected by a slight shrinking of  the stem 
width as the plant dries out! </p>

<p>A complete loss of turgor corresponds to a situation of 
distress in the plant. Although some plant scientists discount
the vanishing of turgor pressure as a mechanism for inducing
the increase of stomatal resistance, it is likely that the 
leaf water potential threshold occurs somewhere near that 
point. For many plants zero turgor is reached when the water
potential in the cells is close to -15 bar. Some scientists 
have suggested that, since the stem also shrinks with decreasing 
water content, a measure of stem diameter changes might 
constitute a measure of soil water content. Although many
plants exhibit a stress threshold at values considerably 
less than (more negative than) or greater than (less negative)
-15 bar, the latter figure has been adopted as the official
wilting point. Choice of -15 bar is also due to the fact that
many soils exhibit a very rapid decrease in soil water
potential with decreasing soil water content near -15 bar.
That is the reason why the choice of soil type (and threshold
water potential for the plant) is so important in this model. 
We can see that this value of -15 bar constitutes almost a 
magic number!
 </p> 
<p>Loss of turgor and incipient wilting need not be permanent 
or even associated with a low soil water content. We see 
examples in which the fluxes exhibit a transient response 
to drying soil, suggesting that control of stomatal resistance
also exists in the leaf or is manifested via the leaf. 
Consider Figure 11.4, which shows two evapotranspiration 
curves made over corn, one curve superposed on the other. 
The curves pertain to two adjacent fields, one irrigated 
and wet the other dry; (we are not sure how wet or how dry 
was the soil in each field, but you can certainly tell 
which is which). Note that the two curves are virtually 
identical in the morning and again later in the late
afternoon; in between the one set of fluxes shows a 
distinct flattening. We refer to this flattening as the
<em>transpiration plateau</em>. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch11_files/11_003.gif" alt="figure 11.4"></p>


<a name="Transpiration"></a>
<p><strong>Modeling the transpiration plateau</strong></p>
<p>
How does this plateau come about and why is it
transient? Recalling the previous scenario, we note 
that the leaf water potential decreases to a minimum
during midday (in accord with the typical rise and 
fall of transpiration during the day). The leaf water
potential may reach a threshold (<em>e.g.</em> -15 bar),
below which the plant sounds the alarm to close its
stomates. We refer to this threshold as the <em>critical
leaf water potential</em>. Below the threshold, the 
stomatal resistance increases rapidly with a further 
decrease in leaf water potential. That increase in 
stomatal resistance will tend to retard transpiration 
and limit further decrease in leaf water potential. 
</p>
<p>We formulate stomatal resistance as a function of 
leaf water potential. This is done as follows: The 
stomatal resistance function (<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch07.html#equations">Eqn. 7.2</a>) is expressed 
in terms of a component (f(ψ<sub>e</sub>)), where ψ<sub>e</sub> is an 
epidermal leaf water potential, which will be described
shortly. When the leaf water potential lies above the 
imposed threshold leaf water potential, stomatal 
resistance depends weakly on leaf water potential (in
the case of our corn plants, that sensitivity to leaf
water potential is taken to be zero<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>). Below the 
threshold, leaf water potential stomatal resistance 
increases very rapidly with decreasing leaf water
content. We represent each regime<a href="#three"><sup>3</sup></a>, below and above 
threshold by straight lines. The pair of straight lines
defining the sub-threshold and super-threshold regimes
intersects at the point forming a sort of ramp 
function. The point of intersection defines the
threshold leaf water potential. In Figure 11.2: the
two straight lines, one horizontal and one sloping 
upward to the right, intersect to define the threshold 
water potential at -16 bar.  
</p>
<p>Because of the scatter of data it is really 
difficult to determine if stomatal resistance is 
at all sensitive to leaf water potential in the 
sub-threshold regime. Since the data is so limited, 
we arbitrarily chose the slope of the line to be zero
in the sub-threshold regime, as in Figure 11.2 (no
sensitivity of stomatal resistance to leaf water 
potential; you can change these slopes in the model 
in specifying a new vegetation type, but, if you do, 
BEWARE). Beyond the threshold, the slope of the line
is very steep. The most important number in this 
equation is, however, the value of the threshold leaf 
water potential. 
</p>
<a name="leaf"></a>
<p>
<strong>Leaf water potential and vapor pressure deficit</strong>
</p>

<p>
Most plant scientists will concede that <em>if</em> a 
leaf potential tripwire exists, (the alarm mechanism
that signals the arrival of the threshold and zero 
turgor), it lies not in the mesophyll, but in the 
epidermis, specifically in the guard cells. Accordingly, 
we relate the stomatal resistance to the epidermal 
leaf water potential ψ<sub>e</sub> . Now, the mesophyll water 
potential ψ<sub>m</sub> 
governs the transpiration in <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html#equations">Eqn. 10.3</a>,
but the epidermal water potential is the appropriate
potential used in the stomatal resistance equation, 
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch07.html#equations">Eqn. 7.2</a>. Epidermal leaf water potential is similar 
in magnitude to that in the mesophyll, although it 
will always be equal to or lower than the mesophyll
potential. We take the difference between the mesophyll
and epidermal leaf water potential to be proportional
to the vapor pressure deficit. The constant of 
proportionality between mesophyll water potential and 
epidermal water potential is called beta, the parameter
you varied in the last scenario. (Don't worry too 
much about this refinement; it's a brand new approach 
to relating stomatal resistance to vapor pressure 
deficit; some plant scientists actually like the 
idea!) The two potentials can behave somewhat 
independently; the epidermal leaf water potential could 
decrease to the threshold, while the mesophyll leaf water
potential increases, in accordance with a decrease in 
transpiration. (See if this helps you answer the question
from Chapter 10 regarding ψ<sub>e</sub>
and ψ<sub>m</sub>).
</p>
<p>The more conventional way to parameterize the vapor
pressure deficit effect is simply to increase the 
stomatal resistance by some function of the vapor pressure
deficit. This is the basis for the so-called 'Jarvis'
formulation, which is basically the form of the stomatal 
resistance equation used in our model, except, of course, 
for the VPD effect. Although the two methods for augmenting 
the stomatal resistance as a function of vapor pressure 
deficit are fundamentally different they tend to produce 
a similar effect when viewed overall. The problem with the
vapor pressure deficit effect is that it tends to mask the 
water potential threshold effect by accomplishing the same 
thing: an increase in stomatal resistance during the middle 
part of the day, although somewhat skewed toward later afternoon. 
</p>

<a name="potential"></a>
<p>
<strong>Leaf water potential and transpiration</strong>
</p>

<p>
As formulated, the stomatal resistance should not vary
with leaf water potential or with soil water content until
the epidermal leaf water potential reaches the threshold 
value. Imposing a threshold leaf water potential in the 
model leads to a midday increase in stomatal resistance when
the transpiration becomes sufficiently large to require the
leaf water potential to fall to the threshold. (A large 
vapor pressure deficit may also cause the leaf water potential
to reach threshold much sooner, according to our formulation.)
When this happens, the transpiration starts to be arrested 
but, at the same time, the rise in sensible heat flux from
the leaf and the concomitant rise in leaf temperature work 
to augment the transpiration flux (by increasing the vapor
pressure deficit). The result of this tug of war is that
the transpiration neither falls nor rises, but forms a
plateau. The lower the soil water content, the more quickly
in the morning the leaf water potential reaches the plateau
and the longer the plateau lasts. Look at your results from
Chapter 9;  this is also the feedback mechanism we were
discussing.
</p>
<p>Note that the leaf water potential may not reach the
threshold value if the soil is sufficiently wet, because 
it starts out from a relatively small negative value. In that 
case no soil water effect will be observed in the simulations.
The same thing may happen if the sky is cloudy and the 
atmospheric demand for transpiration is weak, because then the
leaf water potential will not fall very far in the absence of 
strong transpiration demand. Alternately, the leaf water 
potential may reach the threshold after starting out at a 
relatively small negative value because the demand for 
transpiration is large, the vapor pressure deficit large or 
for other reasons, <em>e.g.</em>, because the denominator of <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html#equations">Eqn. 
10.2</a> is large for some reason; (<em>e.g.</em> Z<sub>p</sub> is large).
</p>
<p>You may have found in your previous simulations that
stomatal resistance and transpiration do not vary greatly
as a function of soil moisture content over a range of 
soil moisture values, although  xylem resistance and 
other factors (such as ambient relative humidity) influence
the behavior of stomatal resistance. When the water 
potential threshold is reached, however, large fluctuations
in stomatal resistance occur. The earlier the onset of 
the plateau the lower the transpiration during the plateau
and the higher the midday stomatal resistance. As 
suggested by <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html">Figure 10.2</a>, the stomatal resistance and the 
transpiration may not change very much from one day to the
next during soil drying until the threshold is reached.
After that, however, and until a general collapse of the
plant occurs (permanent wilting), the changes are 
primarily during the period of the plateau. 
</p>


<a name="final"></a>
<p>
<strong>A final word on the root-shoot controversy</strong>
</p>

<p>As in many such controversies the solution lies somewhere
between the extremes. In all probability, both root and 
shoot influence the stomatal resistance. According to a 
French scientist named Tardieu, the real mechanism goes 
something like this: As the soil dries out cytokinins 
(ABA) are sent to the leaves. When the leaf begins to 
perceive a water loss stomatal resistance is increased 
and more ABA is produced, including in the leaves 
themselves. The effect of this hormone is to accentuate 
the response of the leaf to stress. The root secretions
augment the effect of the threshold, although without 
affecting the stomatal resistance very much before the 
threshold is reached. As the root continues to dry out 
the change in stomatal resistance with decreasing leaf
water potential is enhanced, resulting in a more rapid
increase in stomatal resistance with decreasing leaf 
water potential. Tardieu's solution incorporates elements
of both arguments but preserves the threshold effect.</p>



<a name="values"></a>
<p>
<strong>Values of threshold leaf water potential</strong>
</p>

<p>Values of threshold leaf water potentials vary with
species, age and previous stress episodes experienced
by the plant<a href="#four"><sup>4</sup></a>. Many plants exhibit a threshold close 
to -15 bar (that magic number again ! ), although values 
vary between -9 and -22 bar depending on the species of
plant. We set the threshold at -15 bar in our 'corn' 
simulations. </p>


<a name="two"></a>
<p>
2. That the sensitivity is weak in corn when the leaf
water potential has not yet reached the threshold is
evidenced by the fact that field measurements tend 
to show no significant differences in fluxes from one
day to the next before the threshold is reached but
a considerable difference after the leaf water potential
threshold is reached. An example of this effect is 
shown in Figure 11.4. 
Note that the two fluxes are essentially 
identical except during the period of the transpiration 
plateau for the dry field. This is a form of transient
water stress.
</p>

<a name="three"></a>
<p>3. The simplest possible function to represent an 
exponential consistent with a minimum of data is a 
pair of straight lines which intersect at the point 
where the exponential increase becomes large. This 
type of equation is sometimes called a 'linear 
discontinuous model'. </p>

<a name="four"></a>
<p>4. Evidence suggests that the threshold leaf water 
potential may decrease (become more negative) with 
repeated episodes of soil drying and water stress 
on the plant. This is a form of adaptation. </p>


<a name="interaction"> </a><h2>Interaction between various parameters and threshold leaf water potential</h2>

<p>1) Soil water content
Stomatal resistance does not vary with soil water content
until the threshold leaf water potential is reached. As 
the soil dries out (Figure 10.2), the soil water potential 
diminishes, requiring the leaf water potential to fall to 
lower and lower values each day in order to sustain the
transpiration. After a while, the soil water potential has
decreased sufficiently to allow the leaf water potential to 
reach the threshold, at least for a short time during the 
day; hence the plateau. Soils that dry out rapidly, such as 
sand, will experience a rapid decrease in soil water potential
and therefore cause the vegetation to reach water stress more
quickly. (What do you suppose would occur if you planted a 
vegetable such as potatoes with a threshold leaf water 
potential of -10 bar in sandy soil, which has a field capacity
of about 10% by volume ?) 
</p>
<p>2) Xylem resistance
Making the xylem resistance larger requires the leaf 
water potential to fall to lower values in order to 
maintain the same transpiration. Thus, the leaf water 
potential is more easily reached under moist soil conditions 
when the xylem resistance is large. 
</p>
<p>3) Vapor pressure deficit
The drier the atmospheric conditions, the greater the
vapor pressure deficit, the larger (initially) the
transpiration and so, the lower the leaf water potential;
the lower the leaf potential the more likely that it 
will reach threshold. Since the tripwire in our model 
resides in the epidermal leaf water potential, the 
larger the value of beta the more likely the leaf will 
reach this potential threshold. (Could this response
be a self-protective behavior against drought ? ) 
</p>
<p>4) Solar intensity
Weak sunshine will require small transpiration and
so, is not likely to cause the leaf water potential
to reach threshold unless the soil is very dry. High 
solar intensity will tend to force a larger 
transpiration and so, cause a lower leaf water 
potential to be reached, all other things being equal. 
</p>


<a name="simulations"> </a><h2>Simulations</h2>
<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>Here, we will allow you to make up your own mind on 
the 'root-shoot' controversy by performing a number of 
sensitivity simulations.  Keep an open mind and try and
determine as many mechanistic relationships as you can
from the output.
</p>
<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>
<p><strong>Vary the soil water content</strong></p>

<p>Run the standard summertime corn case, then lower 
the soil water content enough so that the plateau 
appears in the transpiration. Note the variation in 
leaf water potential and stomatal resistance during the 
period of the plateau, as well as the leaf temperature.
Plot soil water content versus stomatal resistance (at 
midday) for three or four values of soil water content 
and see if your graph resembles Figure 11.1. (Be careful, 
if you lower the soil water content too far you may burn
up the plant and cause the model to behave badly.) </p>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>
<strong>Vary the xylem resistance, Z<sub>p</sub></strong>

<p>Induce the plateau by varying the xylem resistance,
Z<sub>p</sub>. What change in Z<sub>p</sub> will bring on the plateau earlier,
an increase or a decrease?  Plot Z<sub>p</sub> versus stomatal
resistance at midday for three or four different values
of Z<sub>p</sub>.  How sensitive is the leaf water potential, 
transpiration, and stomatal resistance to this factor? 
What happens when you lower the xylem resistance?</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the effect of ozone 
deposition on plants, ozone being a toxic gas for tissue, 
is to cause Z<sub>p</sub> to increase; (see Chapter 13). Given this 
fact and your results here, consider what effects atmospheric
concentration of this toxic gas has on plant growth. </p>

<a name="L1S3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 3</em></p>
<p><strong>Vary the beta parameter</strong></p>

<p>Increase beta, (as in a previous scenario) and 
pretend that the corn is somehow sensitive to changes
in vapor pressure deficit. Report on the behavior of
the transpiration plateau and the daily variation of 
stomatal resistance. Also, look closely at the changes 
in leaf and epidermal water potentials as beta is 
varied.  Which of these potentials appears to be the 
'controller' of stomatal resistance based on these 
simulations? </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Suppose that the continuation of water stress
would cause the critical leaf water potential to 
decrease. What effect would this change have on transpiration.</li>
<li>If the xylem resistance (Z<sub>p</sub>) increases
with plant age what effect would this have on transpiration?</li>
<li>Why do you suppose that the leaf water potential
does not decrease very far beyond the critical water
potential threshold in any of these simulations?</li>
<li>Why do you suppose the transpiration is 
almost identical in these simulation prior to and 
after the transpiration plateau?</li>
</ol>

<p>It should be obvious that there is no clear winner
to the 'root-shoot' debate, and that there are many 
interactions and influential variables when it comes 
to stomatal closure and transpiration.  The fact that 
soil water content was not varied in simulations 2 and
3 should tell you that root control is not the sole 
answer, and that stomates respond to what the leaf status
is as well.  Just peer out of the closest window and
you will see a multitude of variations of plant types
and sizes.  Thus far, we have considered a full, dense 
plant canopy with maximum solar radiation.  Do you
think a plant growing on its own, without the aid of 
a buffered canopy, might respond differently to the
stresses examined in these simulations?</p>

<p>Try setting up a sparse corn canopy (lower 
the fractional vegetation cover and/or the LAI), 
submitting it to the changes in VPD, xylem resistance,
and soil water content just performed.  Does it 
appear that plants who are 'loners' have extra 
sensitivity to certain changes than those nestled 
in a large canopy do?  Compare to your results from
simulations 1-3 to see which type of plants are 
better off under certain conditions.  Might you have
any recommendations for the future evolution of 
plants who are out on their own to enable them to 
survive longer?</p>

<p>Slowly decrease soil water content in a series of steps 
from field capacity to something like 0.3 of field capacity,
or at least until the stomatal resistance begins to 
rise markedly. Plot soil water content versus mid day 
stomatal resistance. Imagine yourself fitting some
polynomial function to the curve you just obtained.
Argue whether this function would be easier to use 
in a land surface model to calculate stomatal resistance
as a function of soil water content than having to 
formulate the entire plant hydaulics as in our model. </p>

<p>We have appreciated for some time how wide a range of 
environmental factors can elicit a response from a single 
pair of cells, but to date much research on plant water 
deficits has concentrated upon characterization of the effects
of a deficit-induced increase in a single inhibitor of stomatal
opening, namely, ABA. It now seems likely that water deficit 
may also reduce the concentration in the leaves of promoters of 
stomatal opening, and thus it is more realistic to expect that
the balance of regulators in the leaves will help to determine
the degree of stomatal opening. Stomatal behavior in different
species under varying environmental conditions must be interpreted
in terms of variation in one or more components of an interactive 
system linking external and endogenous factors. Changes in the 
levels of single components may or may not elicit a response, and 
the interactive system operates so that a change in a single 
component may be promotive or inhibitive, depending on the prevailing
conditions. </p>
