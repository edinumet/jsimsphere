<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 8</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Now that we are somewhat familiar with the concept of a vegetation canopy, 
let us drop into that canopy to examine its microclimate. In so doing, we 
shall introduce two new ideas: The first, which is non-controversial, is that
 the structure and density of the plant canopy can influence the plant microclimate.
 The second, which is not accepted by all scientists, is that an ensemble of 
plants can compensate for increased atmospheric demand for water vapor by 
modifying its canopy environment. In the next two chapters we shall examine 
some possible <strong>negative feedback</strong> mechanisms that allow the plant to compensate
 for excessive atmospheric demand or even for a change in its own physiological
 makeup. We shall begin with the vertical structure of the temperature, wind, 
and water vapor content inside the plant canopy and try to understand what 
factors are important in affecting the canopy climate. 
</p>
<p>Before exploring the consequences for the internal feedback mechanisms in the
 plant microenvironment, we would like to present an abridged discourse on the 
subject of photosynthesis, courtesy of an old biology textbook (Hardin, 1966;
 pp 231-232). We feel that some background information on this plant process is 
useful, if not essential, for understanding this and subsequent scenarios. Any 
decent biology book should provide the same information. 
</p>
<a name="background"></a> <h2>Background</h2>


<p><em>Photosynthesis</em></p>

<p>Before the early eighteenth century, scientists believed that plants received all 
their nourishment from the soil. Later, it was understood that their nourishment
 was derived from the atmosphere and that light was an integral part in the process. 
A Swiss minister named Senebier showed late in the 18<sup>th</sup> century that 
CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O + light energy yields O<sub>2</sub> + plant material. Thus, 
light and water are necessary to convert carbon dioxide into sustenance for the plant. 
</p>
<p>Later, investigators realized that the material being formed in the plant consisted 
of carbohydrates, whose chemical formulae contains combinations of carbon and hydrogen 
atoms. The production of carbohydrates, however, occurs only within the green areas of
 the leaves, in cellular bodies called <em>chloroplasts</em>. The chloroplasts contain a 
chemical compound called <em>chlorophyll</em>, which exists in a variety of similar forms. 
Chlorophyll is required if photosynthesis is to take place.
</p>
<p>If a chlorophyll molecule is exposed to light, excited electrons are captured and 
used to synthesize molecules, such as <em>adenosine tri phosphate (ATP)</em>, which is used 
'to fuel' chemical reactions in the plant. (Incidentally, ATP is also used in human 
cells and is an essential, though limited, fuel burned withinthe muscles that 
enables atheletes to achieve high performance.) A second series of reaction involves
 the splitting of water molecules, a process aided by the presence of the chlorophyll
 where a compound nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADPH) is the end product. 
These reactions are part of the <em>light reactions</em> of photosynthesis. Rather than 
become ensconced in details you should simply consider the role of these compounds 
as sources of energy along the pathways in the synthesis of carbohydrates. 
</p>
<p>The photosynthetic process is not fully realized until the amount of organic carbon
 in the cell is increased. This is done by coupling CO<sub>2</sub> (inorganic carbon) with
 organic compounds, reactions called <em>dark reactions</em> (because they do not require 
sunlight), which produce a variety of constituents in the plant cell (essentially 
carbohydrates). For your information, there are three pathways that photosynthesis 
can follow: C- 3, C- 4 and CAM (crassulacean acid metabolism).
</p>
<p>Although plants generally intake carbon dioxide and exhale oxygen, some reactions 
liberate carbon dioxide, and it is passed back into the atmosphere. This exhalation
 is called <strong>respiration</strong>; respiration that occurs without the aid of sunlight is 
called <em>dark respiration</em>. Generally, the amount of carbon dioxide respired to the 
atmosphere is small compared to that taken up by the plant. However, dark respiration 
can occur at night, resulting in a rise in ambient carbon dioxide concentration in
 the plant canopy. An even more important source of carbon dioxide in the plant 
canopy is produced as a by-product when dead plant material decays. Since the latter 
type of reaction can also occur at night, the night time concentrations of carbon 
dioxide inside the canopy sometimes rise to levels above normal daytime 
concentrations, as shown for the CO<sub>2</sub> nighttime profile in 
Figure 8.1. We will have more to say about this in a later scenario.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="ch08_files/8.gif" alt="figure 8.1">
</p>


<a name="vertical"></a> <h2>Vertical structure of temperature, wind speed 
and humidity in a plant canopy</h2>


<p>It doesn't take a meteorologist to realize that wind speed increases with 
height and that temperature decreases with height away from a surface heated by 
the sun, whereas at night, the temperature increases with height away from a 
surface through radiative cooling. However, let's consider what happens inside 
a plant canopy during the day and at night. 
</p>

<p><em>Windspeed</em></p>

<p>If we were to plot time-averaged wind speed versus the log of height, the 
profile would tend to be a straight line. In linear space, this distribution 
of wind speed is shown by the dashed lines on the wind speed profiles in a Figure 8.1. 
The height at which the time-averaged wind speed extrapolates to a zero 
wind speed is called the <em>roughness height</em>, a parameter you may have already 
encountered. The higher the vegetation, the larger the roughness height. In 
general, agronomists take the roughness height to be about 0.1 the height of 
the vegetation, for a uniformly distributed vegetation canopy. Agronomists 
also refer to a <em>displacement height</em> (h), which is the height above the ground
 surface that the logarithmic wind profile 'sees' as the ground surface; this
 is typically about two-third's the height of a uniform vegetation canopy.  
Therefore, to calculate at what level the roughness height of a 1 meter canopy
 is, you must first account for what the atmosphere sees as the ground surface,
 which would be 2/3 of 1 meter, for a displacement height of .667 meters.  
Then, the roughness height, which is .10 of 1 meter, would correspond to .10 
meters above the .667 level, or .777 meters above the actual ground surface. 
 Keep in mind that the actual roughness height is still .10 meters, but with 
respect to what the atmosphere sees as the ground, which is now .667 meters. 
(Note: although we talk of roughness and displacement heights in the context 
of vegetation, these parameters are generally applicable to any type of 
surface and the roughness height requires specification in the model.)
</p>
<p>Some care should be taken in interpreting roughness height. First, it
 should be understood that the parameter, while related to the physical 
surface, is only a constant of integration in the log profile law. Second,
 it is possible for two or more roughness lengths to exist at one surface 
location, but each roughness length may apply to a different scale. Third,
 the roughness of a sparse crop canopy can be greater than that of a dense 
canopy because the latter tends to appear as a smoother surface to the 
ambient wind. Thus, a very dense canopy of soybeans may appear to the 
atmosphere as a fairly smooth surface, whose roughness elements consist 
only of the leaves protruding above a relatively uniform surface, whereas
 a canopy of sagebrush with the same height as the soybeans may appear as 
a much rougher surface to the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>Except for the concept of the <em>friction velocity</em>, the logarithmic profile
 laws, such as those used in this model, do not apply immediately above or 
inside a vegetation canopy. Therefore, we need not worry about displacement
 height, except for the fact that Monteith (1990; p. 232) refers to it in
 his discussion of Figure 8.1; taken from his book. In actuality, the wind
 speed does not quite go to zero inside the canopy; instead it reaches a
 relatively small value in the upper third of the vegetation canopy and 
then decreases very slowly with decreasing height; this is illustrated by 
the solid curves in the wind speed profiles in Figure 8.1. The value of the
 wind speed in the slowly decreasing regime is nevertheless a function of 
the so-called friction velocity, which is a function of the wind speed above
 the canopy (at the top of the surface layer) and the roughness height.
</p>
<p><em>Temperature</em></p>

<p>During the day, temperature is maximized at the earth's surface and during 
the night it is minimized. This is also true for vegetation canopies, 
although the maximum temperature tends to occur near the top of the 
vegetation, as shown in Figure 8.1.  This is due to shading of the underlying
 soil, as the soil surface temperature tends to be cooler than the canopy 
temperature (or that just above the canopy) during the day. 
</p>
<p>Up to this point, you have plotted the 'surface radiant' and 'surface air
 temperatures' in your scenarios. Surface radiant temperature is relatively 
easy to imagine for a smooth, bare soil surface, but for vegetation the 
surface temperature becomes an abstraction. As we define it, it is the 
equivalent temperature of the ground, <em>i.e.</em>, the temperature corresponding 
to the amount of upwelling long wave (thermal) radiation from the surface.
 Another important temperature that the model can calculate is the leaf 
temperature (T<sub>l</sub>), which is that appropriate to a sunlit leaf near the top 
of the canopy. The interleaf air temperature (T<sub>af</sub>) is calculated as a 
function of this temperature, the air temperature above the canopy, the 
ground temperature, as well as being a function of various air resistances.
 We can, therefore, take account of six temperatures in the vegetation 
scenarios: the interleaf air space temperature (T<sub>af</sub>), the ground surface 
temperature (T<sub>g</sub>), the temperature just above the canopy (i.e. at screen 
height; T<sub>a</sub> ), the radiometric surface temperature (T<sub>o</sub>), the leaf temperature
 (Tl), and the temperature at the top of the surface layer (50 m). (Let us 
not confuse these temperatures with potential temperature.) 
</p>
<a name="simulations"></a> <h2>Simulations</h2>

<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>
<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>


<strong>Vary the relative humidity near the surface</strong>

<p>a) Run the default vegetation case for the corn canopy (LAI = 3, canopy height = 2 m,
 fractional vegetation cover = 100%, roughness height = .20 m), but this time note the
 distribution of wind speed, temperature and specific humidity (vapor pressure) inside
 and above the canopy. For wind speed, temperature, and specific humidity, look at 
three values: that at the top of the surface layer (50 m), anemometer level (10 m) 
and that inside the canopy (the interleaf air spaces). In addition, plot the vapor
 pressure deficit in the canopy. 
</p>
<p>b) Now, change the relative humidity in the initial temperature-dewpoint sounding.
 Increase the <strong>dewpoint depression</strong> by some factor (say 2.0) at the lowest three 
levels, thus lowering the relative humidity in the lower layers.  Then, decrease the 
VPD by a factor of about two. This can be done by changing the dewpoints in the lower
 part of the sounding in some sensible fashion. Compare the same temperature, 
moisture, and wind speeds as above. Note how the specific humidity and the vapor 
pressure deficit change at 50 meters and in the canopy with this change in external 
relative humidity. Note that the evaporation formula suggests that doubling the 
numerator or denominator (the VPD) should cause evapotranspiration to increase by 
a factor of two.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Are the results at all levels what you expected due to an increased 
atmospheric demand for water vapor?</li>
<li>Does the evapotranspiration change by the same factor as the VPD change?</li>
<li>In this circumstance, does it appear that the corn canopy has decoupled 
wholly or partially from the atmosphere above?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation #2</em></p>

<strong>Vary the resistances inside and outside the canopy</strong>

<p>Keep the same graphs up from simulation 1 to compare to those generated here.</p>

<p>a) Using the same dewpoint depressions as simulation 1, reduce the wind 
speeds by a factor of two at all levels in the sounding. This effectively 
increases surface layer resistances. As you have already discovered in an earlier 
scenario for bare soil, decreasing surface roughness also causes an increase in 
the surface layer resistances. (Alternately, you can produce the same effect by 
decreasing the surface roughness (say by a factor of 10 or 20); if you wish to do
 this instead of changing the wind feel free to do so). This will increase all 
resistances external to the plant, including the leaf boundary layer resistance
 (r<sub>af</sub>) and the resistance between the canopy and the surface layer.
</p>
<p>b) Next, reduce the leaf width by a factor of four (to 0.02 m); this will
 decrease the leaf boundary layer resistance by about a factor of 2 but not 
affect the other resistances to heat and water vapor. What we have effectively
 done here is increased the resistances outside the plant canopy while lowering 
those within.  According to McNaughton and Jarvis, we are decreasing the ratio
 of leaf stomatal to boundary layer resistance as well as decreasing the ratio
 of canopy to surface layer resistance. Think about what has happened to the
 amount of mixing within the canopy compared to above
</p>
<p>Again, note the relevant parameters, especially humidity, and how they 
change. See if the changes in canopy temperature and humidity are as extreme
 as when you reduced the relative humidity in the higher wind regime and
 with the larger leaf size (the base case). 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do you find any evidence of buffering?  (By this we mean to ask 
whether changes imposed in the environment seem to be attenuated within
 the plant canopy.)</li>
<li>How might the leaf size affect the energy budget of the plants?
 Would it make sense for different plants to have different energy 
consumption strategies based on leaf size?</li>
<li>What happens to evapotranspiration over a plant canopy on a windy
 day versus a day with light winds? </li>
</ol>

<a name="L2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>

<p><strong>a) Find optimal conditions for canopy decoupling</strong></p>

<p> Play around with the wind speed (or roughness length), leaf size,
 and initial relative humidity on the sounding to see whether you can
 find optimum buffering, <em>i.e.</em>, a situation in which a change in 
ambient relative humidity is not reflected (or weakly reflected) by 
changes in the canopy relative humidity due to internal feedback. If 
you do find it, reduce the LAI and note how rapidly the effect 
diminishes with decreasing canopy density. Try and get a feel for how 
dense our corn canopy must be to effectively decouple from the atmosphere
 above under ideal conditions. We are not sure whether such a buffering 
(as predicted by Jarvis and McNaughton, 1986 and later by McNaughton 
and Jarvis, 1991) can actually be found in the model, or whether it 
even occurs in nature, but we are very curious to learn under which 
conditions auto-humidification can be induced. Good hunting!
</p>
<p>b) So far, we have been examining variations in our default corn
 canopy.  Now, try changing the type and characteristics of the
 vegetation canopy itself.  For example, change the crop type, canopy
 height (and roughness length), fractional vegetation cover, etc.  
See if the 'optimal conditions' for decoupling you found in (a) also
 work for other types of vegetation, or are there new optimal 
conditions for each variation.  Be creative and only change one 
variable at a time as to not get too confused.  See if there is also
 an optimal canopy height, crop type, etc. for which the canopy 
decouples (is buffered from atmospheric or other external changes) 
most readily.  You may also want to view the effects of changing 
these parameters on the surface radiant temperature, because they 
all have a direct impact on the amount of sunlight which can penetrate
 the soil surface.

<a name="appendix"></a> <h2>Appendix</h2>


<p>The clear message from the above arguments is that the importance 
of stomatal control of transpiration depends on the amount of environmental
 feedback. At the leaf and canopy scales, the gain of the negative feedback
 loops describing temperature and humidity gradients through the leaf 
boundary layers and atmospheric surface layer depends on the ratios of 
leaf stomatal to boundary-layer conductances and the canopy to surface-layer
 conductances. When these ratios are large, we need only crude models of 
stomatal responses, but when they are small, we need much better ones. How
 the stomata respond to leaf-surface saturation deficit will not matter 
much for a canopy of small aerodynamic roughness and large canopy 
conductance because the saturation deficit close to the leaves will not 
change much and such stomatal responses as do occur will have only a small 
effect on transpiration anyway.
</p>
<p>At regional scale, the force of these arguments increases, and even
 the leaf and surface-layer aerodynamic conductances have little effect 
when g<sub>c</sub><sup>1</sup> &gt; 20 mm s<sup>-1</sup> because then the 
dominant negative feedback is by 
way of processes in the whole planetary boundary layer. A corollary is
 that there is no practical justification for using any canopy model 
more complex than the 'big- leaf' model at this scale for areas dominated 
by highly productive agricultural crops. This is doubly true given the
 difficulties of average canopy conductance across a mosaic of different 
fields.
