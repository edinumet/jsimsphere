<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 6</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Now that we move into the second part of the course, we will study the role of vegetation in the modification of the
surface microclimate. It is important that you understand and relate your readings and previous work to the present
conditions which involve the addition of a layer of vegetation at the soil surface. At this point we would like to
introduce the following word of caution: don't prejudge what vegetation will or will not do to the surface energy
balance. Depending on the state of the soil moisture, the state of stress within the plant (we will later define 'stress'),
and the state of the atmosphere (winds, temperature and humidity), plants may evaporate water ('<em>transpire</em>') more
or less rapidly than bare soil, even if the soil water content and atmospheric conditions are identical for both
vegetated and bare soil surfaces.
</p>
<p>
The concept of soil water content, especially for plants, becomes an increasingly more complex idea as one examines
its various aspects. Take, for example, the concept of moisture availability. To what extent does moisture availability
control surface fluxes when applied in a model for a vegetated surface? This is just one example, but there are many more,
and you will need to question their significance within the context of vegetation. We will, as before, begin very simply
by considering just a few important parameters, but we will soon gain ground (excuse the pun) and add several levels of
abstraction which may well be quite new to many of you.
</p>
<a name="plantphys"></a> <h2>A Little Plant Physiology</h2>

<p>As scandalous as it may seem, some plant scientists believe that plants do not have a mind of their own, at least when
it comes to the exchange of water vapor with the atmosphere. Idso (1983) even had the nerve to suggest that plants act as
passive wicks and simply transfer water through their straw-like little bodies between the soil and the air, in response
to atmospheric demand and availability of water in the soil. These poor veggy creatures, says Idso, have no say whatsoever
in the face of atmospheric 'extortion'. If the air is dry, the sun strong and the wind speed large, the plants must cough
up more water vapor or face the consequences. Or must they? Can plants do anything about their environment? Can they form
a union and resist outside demands on their well-being.
</p>
<p>The problem lies in the fact that plants do not benefit by losing water to the atmosphere. The water evaporated from
their leaves (<em>transpiration</em>) is parted with reluctantly. (Plants can store a certain amount of water in their roots,
stems and leaves - for a 'rainy' (or, rather, a dry) day so to speak ! ).  (Note that transpiration plus evaporation from
the surface of the earth together is called <em>evapotranspiration</em>.) Plants must nevertheless transpire for two reasons.
First, they need to obtain sustenance to live by bringing up nutrients in the form of sap from the roots; they must also
reproduce, and in order to do so the plants must absorb carbon atoms in the form of ambient carbon dioxide vapor
(CO<sub>2</sub>) though many small pores, called <em>stomates</em>. (Unlike you and me, plants take food from both ends!)
As carbon dioxide enters the leaf, and nutrients and water enter the roots from the soil, water vapor escapes by the same
route to the outside, after first being evaporated from liquid water in the <em>substomatal cavities</em> -- the
intercellular air spaces (Figure 6.1 shows a schematic illustration of the leaf structure see Jones, 1983; p 110). Water
vapor then escapes through the surface of the leaf to the surrounding airstream. Carbon dioxide enters by the same path,
but in the opposite direction and with nearly identical aerodynamic parameters (<em>resistances</em>). There are thousands
of stomates on a typical leaf, but an individual one is so small that it cannot be seen with the naked eye. A small
fraction of the water in the intercellular leaf mass avoids the main route through the stomates and is conducted through
the outer waxy surface of the leaf, called the <em>cuticle</em>, to the surrounding air layer.
</p>
<p>The second reason for the plant's parsimonious behavior with regard to water vapor is that <em>photosynthesis</em> is
limited by sunlight. The more sunlight the larger the <em>assimilation rate</em> of carbon by the plant. However, under
strong sunlight the leaf temperature can rise to dangerous levels, subjecting the plant to heat prostration, to which it
responds by ceasing to make new tissue, losing its leaves or simply dying. In order to regulate its temperature, the plant
must evaporate water from its leaves, thus keeping the plant cool (evaporation is a cooling process).
</p>
<p>The ratio of the carbon assimilation rate (FCO<sub>2</sub>) to the transpiration rate (<em>e.g.</em> per unit leaf area
T<sub>r</sub>) is a measure of the <em>water use efficiency</em> of a plant. For the plant, its game is to maximize the water
use efficiency by holding on to as much water as it can while still absorbing a maximum amount of CO<sub>2</sub>. Some
plant scientists believe that each plant has evolved an optimum efficiency ratio for its particular set of conditions.
Lower the efficiency and the amount of biomass produced by the plant decreases.
</p>
<p>Much of the information above is provided as an introduction to how plants survive, operate, and affect the
atmosphere.  We will get into more detail on these processes in later chapters, after we learn how vegetation, in general,
affects the surface energy budget differently than a bare soil surface does.
</p>

<a name="simulations"></a>
<h2>Simulations</h2>

<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Simulations (Level 1)</strong></p>

<p>
The object of this scenario is to run the model with a standard set of vegetation parameters (as in scenario 1) and
compare the results with the bare soil case which you will need to rerun. The reason for rerunning the bare soil case is
to compare it with simulations made for a realistic crop canopy for which we can reasonably estimate the parameters. Do
not become overwhelmed with the vast amount of detail and options that face you in the vegetation scenario. Take each
step, one at a time and do not become lost changing a vast number of parameters. As we emphasized in the introduction to
this chapter, do not expect that the results for the vegetation simulation will differ greatly from those for bare soil,
or that the differences are specifically due to vegetation. Since things will get a bit complicated, let us just examine
the latent heat, sensible heat and ground fluxes and the surface temperature for this Chapter. One word of caution: the
moisture parameter that governs the plant hydraulics is the root zone moisture availability, which is set independently of
the surface moisture availability (although the two soil layers can exchange water according to the vertical gradient of
soil water). If  you set the root zone moisture availability at too small a value you will kill the plant. The model
reacts to this senseless act of butchery by yielding bizarre results or simply dying! (Do not be alarmed if the values
bounce around a bit during the first hour of the simulation. Like you and me, the plants take a bit of time to get going
in the morning. Note also that the vegetation module applies only during conditions of positive net radiation; at night
the surface is treated if the vegetation were absent.)
</p>

<a name="L1S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Include vegetation</strong>

<p>Run a standard simulation for the bare soil case, that is the simulation you started with in the first chapter. Then,
introduce a mature corn canopy to the model by assigning the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>leaf area index (LAI) of 3.0,</li>
<li>fractional vegetation cover set at 100%,</li>
<li>surface roughness of 20 cm (0.2 meters),</li>
<li>vegetation height of 2 meters,</li>
<li>vegetation type <strong>corn</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>As before, use a <em>surface</em> moisture availability of 0.5. However, assign the same value of 0.5 for the <strong>deep
layer</strong> moisture availability (and be careful if you ever choose to decrease this parameter below 0.3 - 0.4 when
vegetation is specified. Make a simulation under these conditions and compare your results to the standard case you
obtained for the non-vegetated conditions with the same soil water content, concentrating solely on the surface fluxes,
including the ground flux, and the surface temperatures.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The above parameters are representative of conditions in a mature corn field.
Consult the 'users guide' for more details on these parameters as well as the relationship between LAI and fractional
vegetation cover.
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How has this corn field affected the surface energy budget and the surface temperature?</li>
<li>Are the changes as you would expect?</li>
<li>Why does there appear to be a lag in the maximum ground flux for the vegetated run?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the surface and root zone moisture availability</strong>
<p>Run simulations for both the bare soil (standard) and vegetation cases above in which you increase the surface and root
zone moisture availability to 0.9.You should have made 4 simulations in all so far.
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What are the sensitivities of the surface fluxes and temperatures to increasing soil water content in vegetated versus
bare soil simulations?</li>
<li>Is surface moisture availability a more important parameter in determining the surface energy budget for bare soil or
for vegetation?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation  series 3:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the leaf area index (LAI)</strong>
<p>Restore the moisture availability to their original values of 0.5.  Now, vary the LAI from 3.0 to 7.0  and then from
3.0 to 1.0.  (It is not a wise idea to let LAI become less than 1.0, as this begins to pose a contradiction in terms.)</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Which component of the surface energy balance (which flux) does a change the thickness (LAI) of the vegetation canopy
affect most?</li>
<li>Are the overall changes in the fluxes and temperatures due to the varying LAI more or less drastic than those seen in
simulation 1?</li>
<li>At what values of LAI do the results begin to show an insensitivity to changing LAI?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S4"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 4:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the thermal inertia and/or moisture availability</strong>
<p>Try varying the thermal inertia from 12 to 6 TIU or the moisture availability from 0.5 to 0.9 at differing levels of
LAI (1,3, or 7).  Focus on the magnitude of the changes in fluxes due to these parameters being varied.
</p>
</li>
</ul>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What can you conclude about the importance of soil surface characteristics (e.g., thermal inertia or M at the surface)
for the fluxes in the case of dense and of sparse vegetation?</li>
<li>Are these two parameters more important for bare soil or vegetated conditions?</li>
<li>What about for sparse vs. dense vegetation?  Is Mo more important that thermal inertia overall?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S5"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 5:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the fractional vegetation cover</strong>
<p>Perform a vegetation simulation identical to that of simulation #1.  Next, lower the fractional vegetation cover from
100% to 50% and compare it with the original run.  This indicates that half the ground is covered by corn with an LAI of
3.0, while the other half of the ground consists of bare soil.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Bear in mind that the model output represents the combined, average fluxes from the vegetated and bare soil areas.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What major changes do you see in the flux and temperature output?</li>
<li>Does fractional vegetation cover appear to be a more or less important parameter than the LAI?</li>
<li>How do the surface fluxes and temperature vary with changing vegetation cover?</li>
<li>At what point does a variation in fractional vegetation cover become relatively unimportant, or at least much less
sensitive than in changing from no vegetation to 20% vegetation, say?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S6"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 6:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the surface roughness</strong>
<p>Finally, if you feel like playing still more with the model, vary surface roughness (z<sub>o</sub>) and see how things
change. The present value corresponds to a full, mature corn canopy with a roughness of 20 cm (about 0.1 the height of the
corn). After running the standard case, change the roughness to 10 cm and then 30 cm. Again, these simulations are
designed to give a feel for the impact certain parameters have on the atmosphere. Some parameters, as we have seen, have a
much greater influence than others do, and it is important to know which ones if we are to push ahead and utilize this
model to its fullest potential. One thing to remember about roughness length is that it always appears in the mathematical
formulation in a logarithm function.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Do you see much change in the energy budget or temperatures?</li>
</ol>

<p>
If you wanted to be a little more realistic in this scenario, a decrease in the roughness might also correspond to a
decrease in the height of the corn canopy, size of the leaves, and the LAI.  We again iterate that you confine yourself to
changing just one parameter. Changing everything at once and running the model may give you the impression of driving a
souped up car, but the experience may also be 'dangerous', not the least danger of which is being unable to interpret the
results!! In any case the suggestions for additional simulations made in these last two or three paragraphs are only to
provoke conjecture as to how the various fluxes, temperatures and winds might respond to changes in external parameters.
There is obviously not enough time to do everything.
</p>

<a name="L2"></a>
<p><strong>Simulations (Level 2)</strong></p>

<p>
Construct a graph in which the vertical axis is labeled fractional vegetation cover and the horizontal axis is labeled
surface radiant temperature. With M<sub>o</sub> = 0 vary the fractional vegetation cover from zero to 1.0. (Remember that
zero fractional vegetation cover renders LAI meaningless.) Plot this line on the graph. Then do the same for M<sub>o</sub>
= 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0. Plot these lines. Now you have an overview of the sensitivity of the surface radiant
temperature over the full range of M<sub>o</sub> and fractional vegetation cover. You can do the same for
evapotranspiration.
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What sort of shape does the overall plot make. Contrast the behavior of the Mo isopleths in your graph versus the
evapotranspiration isopleths.</li>
<li>Give a fractional vegetation cover of 0.2, what is the warmest that a surface radiant temperature can become when
M<sub>o</sub> goes to zero? Why doesn't the evapotranspiration go to zero at this point?</li>
<li>In what part of the figure would one no longer be able to realistically differentiate values of M<sub>o</sub>, given a
surface radiant temperature and a fractional vegetation cover measurement?</li>
<li>Draw an arrow to represent the change in M<sub>o</sub>, surface radiant temperature and evapotranspiration to
represent a land surface parcel undergoing development over time from a corn field to a housing development.</li>
<li>After reflecting on question 4, draw another arrow to represent the changes that would occur if you were a landscape
architect and could plant some grass and tree cover on your development.</li>
