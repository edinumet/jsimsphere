<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 9</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As in real life, things get more and more complex with time. Up until 
now, we have allowed the stomatal resistance to vary only with solar 
intensity and leaf water potential (an indirect function of soil water 
potential). So far, however, the leaf water potential effect would have 
been weak because we have not tried to stress the plant. In addition, we 
have not allowed the stomatal resistance to vary with vapor pressure 
deficit, although such is the case for many plants. This was reasonable,
so far, in that our previous chapters have treated the case for corn 
which we know exhibits a relatively weak relationship between stomatal 
resistance and vapor pressure deficit. In this chapter, we will allow 
stomatal resistance to vary with vapor pressure deficit <em>(VPD)</em>, although 
in so doing we could end up creating a somewhat anomalous corn plant in
the computer (sort of a cross between corn and soybeans). What happens 
inside the vegetation canopy when we make stomatal resistance a 
function of VPD? Here is a philosophical question: Why do some plants 
make use of the VPD feedforward effect and others not as much? In 
exploring this issue we dig deeper into the can of worms labeled 
'crop modeling'.  </p>

<a name="background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Before starting this discussion let us define what we mean by 
vapor pressure deficit. VPD can have many definitions, the vapor 
pressure difference between the vapor pressure value at air 
temperature saturation (say at screen (1.3 m) level) and that of 
the air at that level. It could also refer to the difference between
the value at the saturation temperature of the canopy or the leaves
and that in the atmosphere, either above or inside the plant canopy.
We will take VPD generally to mean the difference between the 
saturation vapor pressure at the leaf surface and that in the 
immediate surroundings of the leaf, say just beyond the leaf 
boundary layer. </p>

<p>As stated in Chapter 8, many plants (such as soybeans and 
various species of trees) tend to increase their stomatal resistance
in response to an increase in vapor pressure deficit (Jones, 1983;
pp. 120-128). Figure 9.1 shows that variations in stomatal 
conductance as a function of vapor pressure deficit differ from one
type of plant to another; (note that 1 kPa is equal to 10 mb). 
Clearly, plants that have the capability increasing their stomatal 
resistance with increasing VPD enjoy an advantage in dry climates 
or in climates that fluctuate - would you agree ?  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9.gif" alt="figure 9.1"> </p>

<p>
Consider the typical evolution of vapor pressure deficit during the day: 
As leaves become warmer in the sunlight, the saturation vapor pressure 
of the leaves increases. Because of the exponential increase in
saturation vapor pressure with increasing temperature, that increase
in vapor pressure in the sub-stomatal cavities is also exponential with
increasing temperature. Unless the transpiration can somehow sustain an
increase in interleaf vapor pressure equal to that inside the leaf, the
vapor pressure deficit between leaf and interleaf air spaces will 
increase until sometime in the afternoon, when the leaf temperature 
begins to decrease. Obviously, the lower the leaf temperature, the less 
will be the increase in VPD and the less the water loss. The plant has 
a problem here; how to keep its leaf temperature low enough not to cause 
excessive water loss by having a large vapor pressure deficit. If it
tries to reduce transpiration by increasing its stomatal resistance,
its leaf temperature will increase and so will the VPD. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_003.gif" alt="figure 9.2"> </p>

<p>Allowing stomatal resistance to increase with increasing VPD will 
retard the typical decrease in stomatal resistance during the first part
of the morning (in response to increasing sunlight) and even cause it
to increase temporarily for a period during the middle portion of the 
day, resulting in a minor midday maximum (Figure 9.2, McNaughton and 
Jarvis 1991; their figure 9).  Recent experimental evidence suggests 
that photosynthesis increases with increasing leaf temperature up to 
some value, above which the leaf begins to shut down its stomates.  
This suggests that stomatal resistance tends to decrease up to this 
temperature because it is in the plant's interest to maximize its growth.
 Now, we have said that increasing the resistance (or decreasing the
conductance) of the stomates retards the transpiration, increases the
sensible heat flux, the leaf temperature and, accordingly, the VPD, 
thereby retarding any decrease in transpiration. This situation 
constitutes a positive feedback gain between leaf temperature, VPD 
and stomatal resistance, as discussed in an earlier handout on feedback 
processes. This type of response is shown in Figure 9.3 (Korner 1985, 
his figure 3). 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_004.gif" alt="figure 9.3"> </p>

<p>The type of feedback called feedforward (see previous scenario for
introduction of the term), is discussed by Jones (1983; pp 125 - 128).
Feedforward is distinguished from ordinary feedback between VPD and 
stomatal resistance in that a change in stomatal resistance (or 
conductance) affects the heat fluxes and therefore the transpiration.
 Ordinary feedback between VPD and transpiration causes an increase 
in transpiration with increasing VPD. If the increase in VPD also 
causes an increase in stomatal resistance (the exact mechanism for this
is still being debated), but not enough to reduce the transpiration, 
this constitutes negative feedback. In feedforward, an increase in VPD
causes an increase in stomatal resistance, and a decrease in 
transpiration. In other words, the process of transpiration increasing 
during drier conditions is reversed so that lower humidity will now 
result in less transpiration as well. (Sometimes in human activities, 
such as in competitive foot or bicycling racing, excessive loss of water
may cause the sweat mechanism to go haywire and cease, resulting in a 
dangerous overheating of the body.) 
</p>
<p>Feedforward is therefore a more direct and efficient mechanism 
(having one fewer step in the process) for retarding transpiration.
Unlike ordinary feedback, it can actually lead to a reduction in 
transpiration with increasing VPD. This is illustrated in
Figure 9.4 (from Jones, 1983; his figure 6.14). Note that the rapid decrease in 
stomatal conductance with increasing vapor pressure deficit for the 
apple tree (Figure 9.1; M7) causes a reversal in the slope of the
transpiration curve above VPD = 0.9 kPa (9 mb) in Figure 9.3. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_002.gif" alt="figure 9.4"> </p>

<p>The exact
mechanism for the VPD effect on stomatal resistance is still being 
debated, but it is thought to be associated with cuticular (or <em>peristomatal</em>)
transpiration. By that we mean that the plant sensors of VPD may be
the epidermal cells of the leaf cuticle which can sense the dryness of
the air in contact with those cells. Here, an increase of dryness of
the atmosphere will be felt as a slight desiccation by the epidermal 
cells, which trigger a response to that dryness in their buddies, the 
guard cells. Much of this still rests in the realm of speculation, 
however. Still, many plant scientists believe that, although independent
of stomatal resistance, cuticular transpiration triggers a response 
in the stomatal resistance. 
</p>

<a name="canopy"></a>
<h2>Canopy control of VPD; a reprise</h2>


<p>Since either type of positive feedback would result in a decrease in carbon
dioxide intake—or at least a reduction from the optimum possible intake—it 
seems reasonable to suppose that the self protective aspects of feedback 
or feedforward, while helping the plant to conserve its water, would have 
detrimental aspects, not the least of which is a retardation in plant growth. 
</p>
<p>Let us therefore return once again to the idea of <em>auto-humidification</em>. 
Auto-humidification is a word we have coined to suggest that the plant 
canopy tends to retain a higher humidity (much as a crowded theatre might be
perceived as humid) than in the atmosphere above the canopy and maintain 
that higher humidity as a buffer against a detrimental decrease in relative 
humidity in the atmosphere above the plant canopy, as might occur during a
hot, sunny day. Auto-humidification, therefore, would seem to provide a 
more efficient optimization of carbon dioxide intake in the face of a dry 
environment. One is further prompted to speculate that any such feedback 
mechanism must be beneficial to the plant in its normal (evolutionary) habitat
but might have a detrimental effect in habitats for which the particular 
plant has not evolved. You began to explore in the last scenario the idea 
that the ambient relative humidity above the canopy (e.g. at 50 m) may not 
depend on the nature of the underlying plant canopy, and, conversely, the 
internal (interleaf) relative humidity may vary somewhat independently of 
the surface layer parameters at 50 m, depending on LAI and leaf size, as 
well as on the ambient wind speed and vapor pressure. As stated by McNaughton
and Jarvis (1991; see appendix previous scenario), the coupling or lack of 
coupling between canopy and atmosphere also depends on stomatal resistance,
particularly when the latter depends on vapor pressure deficit (our 
emphasis in this chapter). 
</p>
<p>Idso (1987) has questioned the validity of stomatal resistance 
measurements, specifically the relationship between stomatal resistance
and vapor pressure (measured with an instrument called the <em>porometer</em>, 
one of which our department of meteorology proudly owns !). He and his 
co-workers demonstrate that stomatal resistance, as measured inside the 
canopy, varied little despite large changes in saturation deficit at 1 
m above the canopy. Idso interpreted this to mean that the relationship 
derived from the leaves in the porometer was not valid at the canopy 
scale where leaves are naturally exposed to the atmosphere. Idso 
contends that the problem is due to the fact that one does not take 
into consideration, when measuring stomatal resistance, the net
effect of all leaves in the canopy, not just the sunlit leaves near
the top. 
</p>
<p>Others, such as McNaughton and Jarvis (1991) argue that the reason 
for the lack of sensitivity of the stomatal resistance and the surface
energy fluxes to changing VPD above the canopy is because VPD varies 
much less within the canopy. Which view is correct depends, in the words
of McNaughton and Jarvis (1991), 'upon whether the gains in the 
individual feedback pathways that operate at canopy level are sufficient
to stabilize transpiration, making it largely insensitive to changes 
in (stomatal conductance) and on how the experiments were conducted'. 
</p>
<p>This contention underscores how difficult it is to interpret 
micrometeorological measurements in plant canopies. If Jarvis and 
McNaughton are correct, what is the use of the great quantities of 
data showing a variation between stomatal resistance and some vapor 
pressure deficit measured in the atmosphere just above the canopy ? 
One of the problems in relating measurements to model results is the
inevitable averaging of various properties over a scale of the 
canopy, <em>i.e.</em> to approximate a big leaf. The problem becomes even more 
acute in extending the canopy-scale measurements to the regional scale
because now the canopy, like the individual plant in the canopy, is 
embedded in an even larger scale with its interlocking feedback 
mechanisms between individual fields. At the regional scale, the 
individual plant is now two scales down, rather than one scale down 
as if you go from the canopy down to the plant. Fortunately, we will 
stop at the scale of the canopy, and leave inter-canopy interactions 
for other heads to fret over.

<a name="simulations"></a>
<h2>Simulations</h2>

<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>We don't expect all of the previously discussed sophisticated 
and partly unverified ideas to be validated by the simulations.
However, the model does contain a multitude of feedback mechanisms
which can be understood through simulations. The best thing to do 
is to observe these mechanisms by changing one parameter at a time. 
The idea in the level 1 simulations is to vary only VPD and observe
how the transpiration changes. In particular, we would like to 
observe the variation of stomatal resistance with time (as in the
previous scenario) and see if we can show that transpiration 
decreases with time with increasing VPD, at least beyond some 
threshold value of the latter, when we allow rs to depend on VPD.
By allowing a large value of  LAI = 7 we can assume that the 
evapotranspiration (which is the output moisture flux) is very 
nearly equal to the transpiration. To do this without changing 
other parameters is tricky, but we can certainly make an attempt
to do this in a model. The simplest way to change VPD in this 
model is to vary the atmospheric humidity. 
</p>

<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>

<p><strong>Vary the vapor pressure deficit</strong></p>

<p>First, rerun the base case scenario for corn with LAI = 7. Record 
the VPD, stomatal resistance, and latent heat flux (transpiration)
at noon or some reference time of your own choosing near midday. 
Then, run a couple additional cases, each time with a differing 
temperature-dewpoint spread in the lowest three or four levels of
the temperature and moisture sounding (ex., try increasing the 
low level VPD to 2x, 3x, and 4x the default values). This is similar 
to what you have already done in the previous simulation except that
we now want to generate a range of VPD values at your reference 
time only.  Record these values for all your runs. (Don't forget 
that corn is a good example of a plant with a very weak VPD-stomatal
resistance coupling. To specify no linkage between these two 
parameters we set the parameter called 'beta' in the input data 
equal to zero.)
</p>

<p>
Plot the transpiration flux and the stomatal resistance as a function of time. 
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Notice the 'transpiration plateau' near midday which is caused
by the sudden increase in stomatal resistance. How does this plateau 
and stomatal resistance bulge change with increasing VPD?  </li>
<li>Why do you suppose that stomatal resistance increases with 
increasing VPD even though no direct connection is made between these
two parameters in the model? (To understand this fully it may be 
necessary to go on to chapter 10 first.)</li>
<li>What do you suppose would happen to assimilation (carbon dioxide
intake) during the mid day in cases where you see the transpiration
plateau?</li>
</ol>

<p>
More on the transpiration plateau in Chapter 11.
</p>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>

<p><strong>Make the beta parameter non-zero and vary the VPD</strong></p>

<p>The beta parameter is the link between vapor pressure deficit 
and stomatal resistance. The larger the value of beta the more 
strong the relationship between VPD and stomatal resistance. Values
of beta of about 0.05 mb bar<sup>-1</sup> are beginning to be quite hefty; beta 
probably does not exceed 0.10 in nature. It may be small (less than 
0.02) in some plants such as corn.. A zero value should be in place 
for the control run.  (Again, consider why stomatal resistance 
increases with increasing VPD in simulation 1 (where beta = 0)?  
Chapter 10 may shed some light on this if you are stuck)
</p>

<p>Change the value of beta in the model.  Under the vegetation
menu, choose 'custom plants' and choose 'corn'. Assign a 
medium-sized value of beta (.05-.10) and repeat the simulations
with the same atmospheric temperature-dewpoint spread cases that
you just ran for beta equal to zero (simulation 1). Again, record 
the value of VPD, stomatal resistance, and transpiration flux at the
reference time. Now you should have two tables of values from your
simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How does the midday stomatal resistance change with increasing 
initial VPD for the non-zero beta runs?  </li>
<li>Do you see evidence of feedback here, where an increase in VPD
and stomatal resistance acts to reduce the maximum transpiration flux
as compared to simulation 1? </li>
<li>What is the effect of increasing the strength of the VPD-stomatal
resistance link (by increasing beta) on the transpiration, the 
sensible heat flux?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 3</em></p>
<p><strong>Try and find examples of feedforward</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically, as the VPD and corresponding stomatal resistance 
keep increasing, the transpiration should reach a level where it
starts to decrease (feedforward) as VPD is increased. Although this
effect may be elusive, maybe you can... try increasing beta and the
VPD in the atmosphere and plot the noontime VPD versus noontime 
stomatal transpiration for the series of runs to see if a reduction
in transpiration is ever found in the model. Do not abandon this 
exercise, however, but put it aside and return to it again after
having done the simulations for chapter 10. 
</p>

<a name="L2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2 Simulations</strong></p>

<p>We will now combine the ideas discussed in the last two 
chapters.  Try to find out what the effect of autohumidification,
discovered in Chapter 8, would be on the relationships between 
VPD, stomatal resistance, and transpiration discussed here. Make
as many simulations as necessary, using the parameters that 
worked for autohumidification previously and applying them here.
Vary the atmospheric humidity as you did in previous simulations
and note how the in-canopy VPD varies in response.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Does the relationship between VPD and stomatal resistance 
break down if the canopy is buffered from the atmosphere above? </li>
<li>If so, how does this effect the transpiration?  </li>
<li>Do you see any signs of feedback or feedforward in a canopy 
that undergoes autohumidification? </li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that now you are altering numerous parameters, 
some of which have feedbacks on each other.  Therefore, the results
might not be a clear cut as they seem, try and keep an open mind 
and assess all the changes you make equally.  Good luck!</p>

<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 9</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>As in real life, things get more and more complex with time. Up until 
now, we have allowed the stomatal resistance to vary only with solar 
intensity and leaf water potential (an indirect function of soil water 
potential). So far, however, the leaf water potential effect would have 
been weak because we have not tried to stress the plant. In addition, we 
have not allowed the stomatal resistance to vary with vapor pressure 
deficit, although such is the case for many plants. This was reasonable,
so far, in that our previous chapters have treated the case for corn 
which we know exhibits a relatively weak relationship between stomatal 
resistance and vapor pressure deficit. In this chapter, we will allow 
stomatal resistance to vary with vapor pressure deficit <em>(VPD)</em>, although 
in so doing we could end up creating a somewhat anomalous corn plant in
the computer (sort of a cross between corn and soybeans). What happens 
inside the vegetation canopy when we make stomatal resistance a 
function of VPD? Here is a philosophical question: Why do some plants 
make use of the VPD feedforward effect and others not as much? In 
exploring this issue we dig deeper into the can of worms labeled 
'crop modeling'.  </p>

<a name="background"></a>
<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Before starting this discussion let us define what we mean by 
vapor pressure deficit. VPD can have many definitions, the vapor 
pressure difference between the vapor pressure value at air 
temperature saturation (say at screen (1.3 m) level) and that of 
the air at that level. It could also refer to the difference between
the value at the saturation temperature of the canopy or the leaves
and that in the atmosphere, either above or inside the plant canopy.
We will take VPD generally to mean the difference between the 
saturation vapor pressure at the leaf surface and that in the 
immediate surroundings of the leaf, say just beyond the leaf 
boundary layer. </p>

<p>As stated in Chapter 8, many plants (such as soybeans and 
various species of trees) tend to increase their stomatal resistance
in response to an increase in vapor pressure deficit (Jones, 1983;
pp. 120-128). Figure 9.1 shows that variations in stomatal 
conductance as a function of vapor pressure deficit differ from one
type of plant to another; (note that 1 kPa is equal to 10 mb). 
Clearly, plants that have the capability increasing their stomatal 
resistance with increasing VPD enjoy an advantage in dry climates 
or in climates that fluctuate - would you agree ?  
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9.gif" alt="figure 9.1"> </p>

<p>
Consider the typical evolution of vapor pressure deficit during the day: 
As leaves become warmer in the sunlight, the saturation vapor pressure 
of the leaves increases. Because of the exponential increase in
saturation vapor pressure with increasing temperature, that increase
in vapor pressure in the sub-stomatal cavities is also exponential with
increasing temperature. Unless the transpiration can somehow sustain an
increase in interleaf vapor pressure equal to that inside the leaf, the
vapor pressure deficit between leaf and interleaf air spaces will 
increase until sometime in the afternoon, when the leaf temperature 
begins to decrease. Obviously, the lower the leaf temperature, the less 
will be the increase in VPD and the less the water loss. The plant has 
a problem here; how to keep its leaf temperature low enough not to cause 
excessive water loss by having a large vapor pressure deficit. If it
tries to reduce transpiration by increasing its stomatal resistance,
its leaf temperature will increase and so will the VPD. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_003.gif" alt="figure 9.2"> </p>

<p>Allowing stomatal resistance to increase with increasing VPD will 
retard the typical decrease in stomatal resistance during the first part
of the morning (in response to increasing sunlight) and even cause it
to increase temporarily for a period during the middle portion of the 
day, resulting in a minor midday maximum (Figure 9.2, McNaughton and 
Jarvis 1991; their figure 9).  Recent experimental evidence suggests 
that photosynthesis increases with increasing leaf temperature up to 
some value, above which the leaf begins to shut down its stomates.  
This suggests that stomatal resistance tends to decrease up to this 
temperature because it is in the plant's interest to maximize its growth.
 Now, we have said that increasing the resistance (or decreasing the
conductance) of the stomates retards the transpiration, increases the
sensible heat flux, the leaf temperature and, accordingly, the VPD, 
thereby retarding any decrease in transpiration. This situation 
constitutes a positive feedback gain between leaf temperature, VPD 
and stomatal resistance, as discussed in an earlier handout on feedback 
processes. This type of response is shown in Figure 9.3 (Korner 1985, 
his figure 3). 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_004.gif" alt="figure 9.3"> </p>

<p>The type of feedback called feedforward (see previous scenario for
introduction of the term), is discussed by Jones (1983; pp 125 - 128).
Feedforward is distinguished from ordinary feedback between VPD and 
stomatal resistance in that a change in stomatal resistance (or 
conductance) affects the heat fluxes and therefore the transpiration.
 Ordinary feedback between VPD and transpiration causes an increase 
in transpiration with increasing VPD. If the increase in VPD also 
causes an increase in stomatal resistance (the exact mechanism for this
is still being debated), but not enough to reduce the transpiration, 
this constitutes negative feedback. In feedforward, an increase in VPD
causes an increase in stomatal resistance, and a decrease in 
transpiration. In other words, the process of transpiration increasing 
during drier conditions is reversed so that lower humidity will now 
result in less transpiration as well. (Sometimes in human activities, 
such as in competitive foot or bicycling racing, excessive loss of water
may cause the sweat mechanism to go haywire and cease, resulting in a 
dangerous overheating of the body.) 
</p>
<p>Feedforward is therefore a more direct and efficient mechanism 
(having one fewer step in the process) for retarding transpiration.
Unlike ordinary feedback, it can actually lead to a reduction in 
transpiration with increasing VPD. This is illustrated in
Figure 9.4 (from Jones, 1983; his figure 6.14). Note that the rapid decrease in 
stomatal conductance with increasing vapor pressure deficit for the 
apple tree (Figure 9.1; M7) causes a reversal in the slope of the
transpiration curve above VPD = 0.9 kPa (9 mb) in Figure 9.3. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"> <img src="ch09_files/9_002.gif" alt="figure 9.4"> </p>

<p>The exact
mechanism for the VPD effect on stomatal resistance is still being 
debated, but it is thought to be associated with cuticular (or <em>peristomatal</em>)
transpiration. By that we mean that the plant sensors of VPD may be
the epidermal cells of the leaf cuticle which can sense the dryness of
the air in contact with those cells. Here, an increase of dryness of
the atmosphere will be felt as a slight desiccation by the epidermal 
cells, which trigger a response to that dryness in their buddies, the 
guard cells. Much of this still rests in the realm of speculation, 
however. Still, many plant scientists believe that, although independent
of stomatal resistance, cuticular transpiration triggers a response 
in the stomatal resistance. 
</p>

<a name="canopy"></a>
<h2>Canopy control of VPD; a reprise</h2>


<p>Since either type of positive feedback would result in a decrease in carbon
dioxide intake—or at least a reduction from the optimum possible intake—it 
seems reasonable to suppose that the self protective aspects of feedback 
or feedforward, while helping the plant to conserve its water, would have 
detrimental aspects, not the least of which is a retardation in plant growth. 
</p>
<p>Let us therefore return once again to the idea of <em>auto-humidification</em>. 
Auto-humidification is a word we have coined to suggest that the plant 
canopy tends to retain a higher humidity (much as a crowded theatre might be
perceived as humid) than in the atmosphere above the canopy and maintain 
that higher humidity as a buffer against a detrimental decrease in relative 
humidity in the atmosphere above the plant canopy, as might occur during a
hot, sunny day. Auto-humidification, therefore, would seem to provide a 
more efficient optimization of carbon dioxide intake in the face of a dry 
environment. One is further prompted to speculate that any such feedback 
mechanism must be beneficial to the plant in its normal (evolutionary) habitat
but might have a detrimental effect in habitats for which the particular 
plant has not evolved. You began to explore in the last scenario the idea 
that the ambient relative humidity above the canopy (e.g. at 50 m) may not 
depend on the nature of the underlying plant canopy, and, conversely, the 
internal (interleaf) relative humidity may vary somewhat independently of 
the surface layer parameters at 50 m, depending on LAI and leaf size, as 
well as on the ambient wind speed and vapor pressure. As stated by McNaughton
and Jarvis (1991; see appendix previous scenario), the coupling or lack of 
coupling between canopy and atmosphere also depends on stomatal resistance,
particularly when the latter depends on vapor pressure deficit (our 
emphasis in this chapter). 
</p>
<p>Idso (1987) has questioned the validity of stomatal resistance 
measurements, specifically the relationship between stomatal resistance
and vapor pressure (measured with an instrument called the <em>porometer</em>, 
one of which our department of meteorology proudly owns !). He and his 
co-workers demonstrate that stomatal resistance, as measured inside the 
canopy, varied little despite large changes in saturation deficit at 1 
m above the canopy. Idso interpreted this to mean that the relationship 
derived from the leaves in the porometer was not valid at the canopy 
scale where leaves are naturally exposed to the atmosphere. Idso 
contends that the problem is due to the fact that one does not take 
into consideration, when measuring stomatal resistance, the net
effect of all leaves in the canopy, not just the sunlit leaves near
the top. 
</p>
<p>Others, such as McNaughton and Jarvis (1991) argue that the reason 
for the lack of sensitivity of the stomatal resistance and the surface
energy fluxes to changing VPD above the canopy is because VPD varies 
much less within the canopy. Which view is correct depends, in the words
of McNaughton and Jarvis (1991), 'upon whether the gains in the 
individual feedback pathways that operate at canopy level are sufficient
to stabilize transpiration, making it largely insensitive to changes 
in (stomatal conductance) and on how the experiments were conducted'. 
</p>
<p>This contention underscores how difficult it is to interpret 
micrometeorological measurements in plant canopies. If Jarvis and 
McNaughton are correct, what is the use of the great quantities of 
data showing a variation between stomatal resistance and some vapor 
pressure deficit measured in the atmosphere just above the canopy ? 
One of the problems in relating measurements to model results is the
inevitable averaging of various properties over a scale of the 
canopy, <em>i.e.</em> to approximate a big leaf. The problem becomes even more 
acute in extending the canopy-scale measurements to the regional scale
because now the canopy, like the individual plant in the canopy, is 
embedded in an even larger scale with its interlocking feedback 
mechanisms between individual fields. At the regional scale, the 
individual plant is now two scales down, rather than one scale down 
as if you go from the canopy down to the plant. Fortunately, we will 
stop at the scale of the canopy, and leave inter-canopy interactions 
for other heads to fret over.

<h2>Simulations</h2>

<a name="L1"></a>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>We don't expect all of the previously discussed sophisticated 
and partly unverified ideas to be validated by the simulations.
However, the model does contain a multitude of feedback mechanisms
which can be understood through simulations. The best thing to do 
is to observe these mechanisms by changing one parameter at a time. 
The idea in the level 1 simulations is to vary only VPD and observe
how the transpiration changes. In particular, we would like to 
observe the variation of stomatal resistance with time (as in the
previous scenario) and see if we can show that transpiration 
decreases with time with increasing VPD, at least beyond some 
threshold value of the latter, when we allow rs to depend on VPD.
By allowing a large value of  LAI = 7 we can assume that the 
evapotranspiration (which is the output moisture flux) is very 
nearly equal to the transpiration. To do this without changing 
other parameters is tricky, but we can certainly make an attempt
to do this in a model. The simplest way to change VPD in this 
model is to vary the atmospheric humidity. 
</p>

<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>

<p><strong>Vary the vapor pressure deficit</strong></p>

<p>First, rerun the base case scenario for corn with LAI = 7. Record 
the VPD, stomatal resistance, and latent heat flux (transpiration)
at noon or some reference time of your own choosing near midday. 
Then, run a couple additional cases, each time with a differing 
temperature-dewpoint spread in the lowest three or four levels of
the temperature and moisture sounding (ex., try increasing the 
low level VPD to 2x, 3x, and 4x the default values). This is similar 
to what you have already done in the previous simulation except that
we now want to generate a range of VPD values at your reference 
time only.  Record these values for all your runs. (Don't forget 
that corn is a good example of a plant with a very weak VPD-stomatal
resistance coupling. To specify no linkage between these two 
parameters we set the parameter called 'beta' in the input data 
equal to zero.)
</p>

<p>
Plot the transpiration flux and the stomatal resistance as a function of time. 
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Notice the 'transpiration plateau' near midday which is caused
by the sudden increase in stomatal resistance. How does this plateau 
and stomatal resistance bulge change with increasing VPD?  </li>
<li>Why do you suppose that stomatal resistance increases with 
increasing VPD even though no direct connection is made between these
two parameters in the model? (To understand this fully it may be 
necessary to go on to chapter 10 first.)</li>
<li>What do you suppose would happen to assimilation (carbon dioxide
intake) during the mid day in cases where you see the transpiration
plateau?</li>
</ol>

<p>
More on the transpiration plateau in Chapter 11.
</p>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>

<p><strong>Make the beta parameter non-zero and vary the VPD</strong></p>

<p>The beta parameter is the link between vapor pressure deficit 
and stomatal resistance. The larger the value of beta the more 
strong the relationship between VPD and stomatal resistance. Values
of beta of about 0.05 mb bar<sup>-1</sup> are beginning to be quite hefty; beta 
probably does not exceed 0.10 in nature. It may be small (less than 
0.02) in some plants such as corn.. A zero value should be in place 
for the control run.  (Again, consider why stomatal resistance 
increases with increasing VPD in simulation 1 (where beta = 0)?  
Chapter 10 may shed some light on this if you are stuck)
</p>

<p>Change the value of beta in the model.  Under the vegetation
menu, choose 'custom plants' and choose 'corn'. Assign a 
medium-sized value of beta (.05-.10) and repeat the simulations
with the same atmospheric temperature-dewpoint spread cases that
you just ran for beta equal to zero (simulation 1). Again, record 
the value of VPD, stomatal resistance, and transpiration flux at the
reference time. Now you should have two tables of values from your
simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How does the midday stomatal resistance change with increasing 
initial VPD for the non-zero beta runs?  </li>
<li>Do you see evidence of feedback here, where an increase in VPD
and stomatal resistance acts to reduce the maximum transpiration flux
as compared to simulation 1? </li>
<li>What is the effect of increasing the strength of the VPD-stomatal
resistance link (by increasing beta) on the transpiration, the 
sensible heat flux?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 3</em></p>
<p><strong>Try and find examples of feedforward</strong></p>

<p>Theoretically, as the VPD and corresponding stomatal resistance 
keep increasing, the transpiration should reach a level where it
starts to decrease (feedforward) as VPD is increased. Although this
effect may be elusive, maybe you can... try increasing beta and the
VPD in the atmosphere and plot the noontime VPD versus noontime 
stomatal transpiration for the series of runs to see if a reduction
in transpiration is ever found in the model. Do not abandon this 
exercise, however, but put it aside and return to it again after
having done the simulations for chapter 10. 
</p>

<a name="L2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2 Simulations</strong></p>

<p>We will now combine the ideas discussed in the last two 
chapters.  Try to find out what the effect of autohumidification,
discovered in Chapter 8, would be on the relationships between 
VPD, stomatal resistance, and transpiration discussed here. Make
as many simulations as necessary, using the parameters that 
worked for autohumidification previously and applying them here.
Vary the atmospheric humidity as you did in previous simulations
and note how the in-canopy VPD varies in response.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Does the relationship between VPD and stomatal resistance 
break down if the canopy is buffered from the atmosphere above? </li>
<li>If so, how does this effect the transpiration?  </li>
<li>Do you see any signs of feedback or feedforward in a canopy 
that undergoes autohumidification? </li>
</ol>

<p>Keep in mind that now you are altering numerous parameters, 
some of which have feedbacks on each other.  Therefore, the results
might not be a clear cut as they seem, try and keep an open mind 
and assess all the changes you make equally.  Good luck!</p>
