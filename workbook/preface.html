<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Preface</h1>

<a name="purpose"></a> 
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
This book is intended as a hands-on introduction to understanding some land surface processes as they pertain to 
interactions between the soil, atmosphere and plant continuum. It is intended not only to addresse questions posed in the 
text, but to help the readers formulate answers to their own questions, either for academic or professional purposes. 
The subject matter extends over a number of different fields (or disciplines)â€”meteorology, agronomy, horticulture, 
hydrology, forestry and geography. The material, either explicit or implicit, in the book may be of practical 
importance to practitioners and students alike.
</p>

<p>
A unique aspect of this book is the inclusion of a computer model (described below in part 3) along with the text. The 
subject matter does not cover all aspects of land surface processes but only those that can be described with the aid of 
this particular model. To make use of  such a model, one must perform a simulation, so called because the execution is 
intended to simulate (or approximate) a natural process. What differentiates this book from others related to the 
atmospheric surface or boundary layer is that the simulations constitute an integral part of the text. Indeed, the 
model allows the reader to interact with the textual material and therefore become an active participant in the learning 
process. Through use of the model the reader will obtain an understanding in a way that is not directly obtainable from 
any text. It is a Socratic style, except that the reader functions as his own Socrates, posing his own questions that can 
be answered best by performing the appropriate simulation. Thus, the process is open ended by allowing the reader to 
explore aspects of land surface processes in ways that may not have been conceived by the authors. 
</p>

<p>
We envision that this text will be used at more than one level of training. One level is that of university students, 
including those who have not been exposed to formal courses in boundary layer meteorology, plant science, agronomy or 
indeed in any of the various fields that are interwoven in this book. As a formal seminar course at Penn State, 
'Biosphere-Atmosphere Interactions' has functioned successfully using a prototype of this book. In this course, we have 
worked with students from agricultural engineering, meteorology, geography, forest management and agronomy. Despite lack 
of knowledge in the other disciplines, graduate students taking this class have been treated as younger colleagues rather 
than as empty vessels who require filling with knowledge as one would fill the gas tank of a car. The result has been a 
successful interaction with students which led, on more than one occasion, to insightful revelations for the instructors, 
who are the authors of this book.
</p>

<p>
This book, like the seminar course, is intended to serve as an introduction to some sophisticated concepts in land 
surface processes but without becoming highly technical. We believe that it is possible to understand the subject 
material and even to anticipate the outcome of the simulations by thinking physically and intuitively without recourse to 
complex physics and multitudes of equations. Therefore, we deliberately avoid use of  equations n (or express them in the 
simplest possible ways); specialized terminology or lengthy discussions of the physical, chemical or biological nature of 
the process. In that way a meteorologist, for example, will be able to understand how plants work, albeit on a somewhat 
superficial but highly informative level, whereas a plant scientist will gain an appreciation on a basic level how the 
atmosphere affects plants.
</p>

<p>
In combining material from diverse fields, the end result is a combination of subjects and components that exists 
hardly anywhere else in print, such as a discussion of the effect of carbon dioxide on transpiration or of thermal inertia 
on nighttime air temperatures, the importance of moisture at the earth's surface (as opposed to the root zone), the 
importance of feedback in mitigating or enhancing the importance of plants on microclimate and other issues.
</p>

<p>
With its unique mix of scientific disciplines and its absence of excess terminology and mathematics, this book should 
provide a useful cross disciplinary vista for the reader, providing novel insights to the workings of the plant, soil and 
atmospheric canopy and the interaction of the different components. To soften the odious problem of strange jargon, we 
will italicize all terms that represent technical terms in the common language of a particular discipline. Terms 
required for an understanding of the course are listed at the end of each chapter. Terms whose definitions are not fully 
accepted or have not been defined elsewhere are given in quotes. On the other hand, technical terms are introduced and 
discussed in this book that are scarcely treated anywhere else, such as 'moisture availability' and 'auto-humidification'. 
</p>

<p>
This book is also intended for another level, the practicing specialists. By this, we refer to those who have 
professional interests in understanding how their discipline is related to the land surface processes, but whose domain 
falls in other disciplines. For example, a meteorologist might wish to learn more about how the atmospheric boundary 
layer is affected by the plant canopy without having to become a plant scientist or to read and understand a highly 
technical textbook. Similarly, an architect or city planner might wish to determine the solar energy absorbed on a roof 
of a certain color or the effects on surface temperature by planting or removing trees. The answer to these questions 
may not be explicitly given in the text, however, but an understanding of the textual material, coupled with familiarity 
with the model, will allow the specialist to pose his own questions.
</p>

<p>
The chapters in the book are intended to be both read and experienced. We recommend that one first reads the material 
and then performs the simulations, chapter by chapter. Each chapter builds on the last, so that the best approach to 
understanding the material in this book is to undertake each chapter sequentially. Each chapter is divided into two 
sections, which we will simply call "Level 1" and "Level 2". In the first part of each chapter, Level 1, the material is 
introduced, concepts are discussed and a precise set of instructions are provided for carrying out the simulations step 
by step. The results of these simulations are discussed in the text and a set of questions at the end of the chapter are 
provided which are based on the output from the simulations. Level 2 introduces more complexity and suggests additional 
simulations and the possible outcome of these simulations but does not furnish a detailed treatment of the results. 
Moreover, these simulations may be open ended, in the sense that their consequences may not be readily explainable by 
the text material, or that the results may be completely unforeseen even by the authors. The readers are encouraged to 
proceed to whatever level best suits their needs and expertise. In this respect, Levels 1 and 2 are roughly the 
equivalent of undergraduate and graduate level material.
</p>

<p>
It is our hope that the reader will not only learn from the material in the text but also appreciate the limitations of 
a physical model.. Models are not nature but at best a somewhat realistic structure that allows one to gain some insight 
into the natural world. As the model constitutes an integral part of the text, the latter is not intended to delve much 
deeper than the model is capable of describing. Therefore, use of external sources is encouraged in order that the reader 
may gain a much deeper insight into ideas addressed in the text. Several excellent texts already exist which cover a wide 
range of topics relevant to this book. These are included in the list of references and are considered to be supplements 
to the material offered in this book. At times the book adopts a light hearted approach to its description of complex or 
contentious subjects. The authors offer an aplogy if we seem to have slighted or overly simplified these topics but we 
believe that it is important to demystify the subject matter to the extent that specialists in one field are not put off 
in trying to delve into someone else's field.
</p>

<a name="introduction"> </a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Our atmosphere has no real boundary except the surface of the earth. Move sideways and, unless one strikes a mountain or 
an object embedded in the earth, one will never encounter a boundary. The top of the atmosphere is bounded by, literally, 
almost nothing. Indeed, it is very difficult to precisely assign an altitude to the top of the atmosphere. It just 
gradually disappears with increasing height until one is left with a few ions whizzing about. The lower boundary, 
the earth's surface, can not be precisely defined either, but the effect of that surface on the atmosphere is real and 
profound. Looking down from above, however, we would be hard pressed to say what and where the surface is located. Is it 
the tops of the buildings, the surface of the vegetation, or the soil in and around the vegetation? Is it the faces of 
rocks, stones and other debris scattered about on the landscape? Yet, we know when our feet are on the ground and we can 
ask questions about how that ground affects the atmosphere even if we are not too sure of what and where that ground 
surface exists. We live at the surface and the atmospheric events that occur affect us as surface creatures in a variety 
of different ways.  
</p>

<p>
The question is sometimes asked:: "Why is it warm near the surface of the earth and cold at high altitudes, when the 
earth's surface is farther from the sun?" Of course, the sun really warms the earth, which then warms the atmosphere above 
it. Almost all of the solar energy not reflected away by clouds, the atmosphere or the earth's surface is absorbed at the 
ground or in material or objects that cover the ground, such as plants, houses, trees, etc. About 50% of the solar energy 
reaching the top of the atmosphere is ultimately absorbed at the surface of the earth on a sunny day at middle latitudes 
in summer. Thus, the radiator for maintaining the warmth of the atmosphere is at the surface and only indirectly does that 
heat come from the sun.
</p>

<p>
Still, the earth's surface would not exert as much variability on the atmosphere if it were everywhere uniform or if 
all the sun's radiation absorbed by the surface were used to heat the air in contact with it. Thus, the way in which that 
solar energy is partitioned at the surface, is highly variable and highly dependent on the nature of the surface. Some of 
the absorbed solar energy is stored in the ground or locked away in the molecules of evaporated water. Look around you at 
the landscape and you will see an infinite variety of objects comprising the ground surface. No two points on the ground 
are identical. Consider any region one square kilometer in area. It consists of a kaleidoscope of objects, textures, 
colors. The terrain is not flat. There are small hills, gullies, knolls. There are people, dogs, trees, bushes, grass, 
soil. Focus in on any 10 square meter area within that larger square and the surface is equally varied, perhaps with 
patches of vegetation, or a house, part of a road, a little stream. Focus in on a 1 square meter or 1 square centimeter 
area within that larger square and the variegated nature of the surface remains evident, albeit on a smaller scale. The 
soil is speckled with color, rocks protrude, plants or bits of vegetation are visible. Leaves, some shiny some dull, are 
orientated in various directions, deflecting and absorbing the sun's rays, trapping the heat or moisture within the 
vegetation canopy, shading the surface. The variations are endless no matter where we look.
</p>

<p>
There variations in the ground surface figure intimately in the distribution of the solar energy into its components, 
as well as in the reflection of that solar energy. Those components, which are given the names of sensible and latent 
heatâ€”quantities which are to be described and defined in the textâ€”profoundly affect the local climate, the 
so-called 'microclimate' (from the Greek root micro, which in its Anglicized form means small). Because the earth's 
surface is so varied, the microclimate is also endlessly varying on all scales from the very smallest to the size of a 
region. For example, the sea breeze is, familiar to inhabitants along the New England coastline, is manifested by a cool 
breeze which pushes inland from the ocean on warm days. This phenomenon is produced by the contrast between the heated 
land surface and the cooler water, which establishes a pressure gradient from sea to land that drives the cooler air 
inland. The sea-breeze front formed at the leading edge of this cool air may move several kilometers inland during the 
day and extend hundreds of kilometers along the coast. As the warm air is displaced, vertical currents of air develop 
which cause clouds, and occasionally heavy thunderstorms, to form along the sea breeze front. When the day's heating over 
land ceases in the evening, the sea breeze front recedes over the ocean, becoming a land breeze. 
</p>

<p>
Yet on a much smaller scale, the same process that makes a sea breeze is occurring on a sunny afternoon between the 
expanse of macadam in a shopping center parking lot and a surrounding grassy meadow or between wet and dry sand along 
the seashore. One can easily verify the vast difference in surface temperature by walking barefoot across the parking 
lot or dry sand to the meadow or wet sand. Of course, it is unlikely that clouds and thunderstorms will form along the 
edge of a parking lot or between dry and wet sand, but it is nevertheless possible for differences in atmospheric pressure 
to be produced by such differences in temperature, which would induce horizontal and vertical currents of air. Such hot 
spots are also found in nature even when the surface has not been altered by humans. Birds soar in thermals produced over 
the heated face of a rocky outcrop along the sides of a mountain. Even different types of vegetation utilize the solar 
energy differently, so that subtle horizontal temperature variations may be produced over an inhomogeneous vegetated 
surface, e.g,  a corn field adjacent to a forest. Regardless of the scale, wherever there are temperature gradients at 
the surface, there is also pressure gradients which force the air to move horizontally and vertically. 
</p>

<p>
It is not always readily evident, however, what processes are responsible for a particular microclimate. Consider the 
example of a white cement sidewalk aside a strip of green grass on a sunny summer's day. If one considers only the amount 
of absorbed solar energy, it would seem reasonable to conclude that the sidewalk should be cooler than the grass because 
it is reflecting a much greater fraction of the solar energy than the darker grass. It would be immediately evident to 
anyone crossing the sidewalk with bare feet, that the sidewalk is warmer than the grass. The reason, of course, is that 
the grass stays cool by evaporating water and the sidewalk has no means to cool itself. That is precisely how humans can 
maintain a reasonable body temperature while exercising on a hot summer day. Similarly, grass uses much of the solar 
energy to evaporate water rather than to raise the temperature of the grass and the air. By contrast, all of the sun's 
energy is used to heat the sidewalk and the air above it because there is no water available for evaporation. Yet it is 
also possible to imagine a sidewalk that reflected almost all of the incoming solar energy, in which case the sidewalk 
might well be cooler than the grass surface. We can deduce the physical reasoning behind the result that the sidewalk is 
warmer than the grass only by measurement or by experience but we can not be sure, a priori, which process (evaporation 
or reflectivity) will dominate.
</p>

<p>
In fact, it is possible to contrive situations in which the intuition might prove faulty, such as in our imaginary 
scenario in which the sidewalk material is highly reflective. How could we be sure which surface would be the hotter, 
the sidewalk or the grass, in the absence of measurement? Further, imagine that the sidewalk is sloping at an angle to 
the sun and the grass is a flat surface. What is the answer now regarding which surface is hotter? The problem is even 
more complex in this case because the slope of the surface, the reflectivity and the evaporation are factors that must 
be considered.
</p>

<p>
This type of problem can be of considerable practical importance. For example, imagine a scenario in which the two 
sloping sides of a roof face at different angles to the sun at different times of the day and one wishes to determine 
which roof face absorbs the most sunlight and how much each face absorbs during the course of a day. Perhaps one would 
also wish to alter the reflectance of one side of the roof, such that the solar energy absorbed by both sides of the 
roof on a sunny day would be equal. The solution to these problems would be difficult to intuit but they could be obtained 
by calculation if we knew the properties of the surface. 
</p>

<p>
As soon as one tries to calculate something, however, it is necessary to resort to an idealized 'model'. We may know 
the parameters in the problem, at least approximately, but our calculation would refer to an idealized sloping roof 
surface not the actual roof itself. We might choose a simple model of the roofâ€”a sloping surfaceâ€”and make some 
assumptions about parameters involved or the geometry of the roof. We might wish to ignore evaporation and consider only 
slope, azimuth and reflectivity of the roof. As we endeavor to make this calculation we realize that many more factors 
are involved than just the slope, azimuth and reflectivity of the roof surfaces. For example,  the thermal conductivity 
of the roof might need to be considered, or the wind speed and roughness of the roof surface. 
</p>

<p>
Adding to the complexity is the interrelationship between parameters. The reflectivity or the thermal conductivity of a 
surface, such as the sand along the beach, might depend on the amount of water in the surface, as does the 
evapotranspiration. An increase in one of these parameters might actually cause a second one to decrease and a third one 
to increase, but the increase in the third parameter might then cause the second one to increase and the first one to 
decrease. For example, as the soil dries out it becomes lighter, reflecting more solar energy. Drying out of the soil 
causes it to become hotter, as the water content in the soil is gradually exhausted, but the whitening of the soil would 
reduce the solar energy absorbed in the sidewalk. The result is a tug of war between the drying out and the whitening, 
each affecting the heating of the sidewalk a different extent. This tug of war between the different parameters in a 
system is an aspect of what is called feedback. Feedback processes constitute a central aspect of this book and a focus 
of the later chapters. An advantageous attribute of the model is that it allows one to investigate various feedback 
processes in an evolving system.
</p>

<p>
Feedback is a sophisticated concept, which has applications in some very technical areas, such as electronic signal 
processing and the design of high performance aircraft. How can one describe feedback between soil, atmosphere and plants 
qualitatively, that is in words, at the level appropriate to this book? The answer is that it can't be done adequately 
without a model that allows the feedback processes to be implemented and studied by the reader. The formal expression of 
these mathematical interrelationships in this model is called a 'parameterization'. Parameterization simply means that 
one writes out equations governing these relationships between all the parameters; a set of parameterizations constitute 
a model. 
</p>

<p>
The model's purpose is to simulate some of the processes and feedback in the soil/vegetation/atmosphere system. The 
model that describes the soil/vegetation/atmosphere continuum and the transfers of energy, momentum and water through it. 
Such a soil/vegetation/atmosphere/transfer (or SVAT) model refers to a system that is almost infinitely complex. 
<img style="float: right;" src="preface_files/p1.jpg" alt="basic structure model"> Figure 1 shows the basic 
structure of the model we are to use.  Yet, no 
model can be so complex in that it precisely describes the natural world. So it must necessarily be simplified. As one 
often does not know the correct mathematically description of all internal components in the SVAT system, the ultimate 
complexity of the SVAT model is limited as much by one's ignorance as one's tolerance of uncertainty in the results and 
the limitations imposed by cost in time and resources to construct the model. Moreover, were it possible to construct a 
model exactly as complex as nature itself, that model would be as difficult to understand as the unparameterized physical 
world it represents. In that respect, nature is the ultimate model but such a model might be quite bewildering to apply 
and to comprehend even if it could be inserted into a computer. 
</p>

<p>
Thus, the model can answer questions, even some not envisaged by the user, but it can not answer all questions. 
Moreover, it can address specific problems only if the questions are well posed. A silly or absurd result, or even an 
abortion of the simulation, may simply be the model's way of telling the user that the input parameters are not 
reasonable. Like a computer or an automobile, the model will function properly if operated properly. We often read of 
spectacular errors made by a bank or insurance company that are attributed to computer error. Computers very rarely fail. 
Such errors are usually the result of improper use or incorrect data. To aid the reader, a short user's guide to the 
model is provided. Operation of the model should be fairly obvious, however, requiring to special computer skills but 
just a  PC with at least a megabytes or two of hard disk storage, 4 megabytes of memory and Windows 3.1. Any undue 
problems should be reported to the authors.
</p>

<a name="structure"></a>
<h2>Structure of the Book</h2>



<strong>A.  The simulation model</strong><br>
<p>The book consists of a text and the computer simulation (SVAT) model on a floppy disk. The model is one-dimensional. It 
describes various processes in a column that extends from the root zone below the soil surface to a level well above the 
surface canopy. For convenience, let us refer to the surface canopy as the mix of vegetation with underlying soil and 
surrounding bares soil. We will also refer to the vegetation canopy by itself. The latter consists of just the vegetation 
and underlying soil. The processes and quantities described by the model are allowed to evolve in time during a day and 
night (up to 24 hours). Output of the model consists of the surface energy (sensible, latent and stored heat) fluxes at 
the soil surface and in, around and above the vegetation canopy, the flux of momentum above the canopy, the transfer of 
water in the soil and in the plants, the flux of carbon dioxide between the atmosphere and the plants (the carbon 
assimilation rate), the temperature of the soil, leaves and air above the vegetation canopy, the radiometric temperature 
of the vegetation and soil mix, the leaf temperature, the ground temperature beneath the leaves and in the bare patches 
surrounding the vegetation, the temperature of the interleaf air spaces, the wind velocity, temperature and humidity of 
the air above the surface canopy and other parameters.
</p>

<p>
Although the model is limited to one dimension, it has an extra dimensionality in that it implicitly refers to a 
horizontal area of undefined size that contain a mix of bare soil and vegetation. Both vegetation and bare soil model 
function separately but they are allowed to interact. Thus, one can specify a fractional of vegetation cover and other 
attributes of the vegetation and bare soil fractions without having to know the size of the area. Interpretation of the 
results are, of course, a matter to be considered. The model is limited, however, in its description of various aspects 
of the soil, plant, atmosphere continuum, such as the water transfer in the soil, the physiology of plant leaves, the 
structure of the roots, the description of the plant canopy during the night, etc. Because the model is an imperfect 
representation of nature, the user should always question the validity of the output in terms of whether the results 
make physical sense. Sometimes these results are counter-intuitive, but correct. But the reader should always be 
cautious. Caveat Lector! This is a healthy attitude to adopt for any text and by any scientist toward either model 
simulations or measurements.
</p>

<p>
<strong>B.  Contents of the chapters</strong>
</p>

<p>
Each of the X chapters contains a description of the subject, with the aim being to establish enough knowledge and 
critical thinking to execute and evaluate a set of computer simulations. The chapter begins with a short text discussing 
the nature of the subject at hand and introducing some background information and perhaps a few equations and some physics 
necessary to understand the simulations. Simulations follow the introductory text. These are to be carried out as 
exercises, in which the user enters certain parameters in the input data, executes the model and then calls up certain 
graphs or output products. The first set of simulations, 'Level 1' are to be executed with close reference to the text. 
Input parameters are listed separately in a table. Output products are discussed. Level 1 concludes with a series of 
questions for the user. Level 2 is more free form, an adventure for the user. It begins with some more description, 
followed by suggestions for further simulations. Level 2 poses questions that might be answered by the user at some 
later time and which may have no obvious solution. In these cases the design of the simulations and the exact choice 
of parameters are left up to the user. A series of terms to be looked up elsewhere or particular to the text is listed 
at the end of the chapter. This is followed by equations used in the text and by a list of references for the material 
contained in the chapter. 
</p>

<p>
No detailed knowledge of any one of the disciplines comprising the text material is assumed. For example, long wave 
(thermal) radiation is mentioned, but the Planck black body relationships are not discussed in any detail, nor is the 
geometry of radiation or the concept of extinction coefficients. This type of material can be obtained in other texts, 
such as those referred to at the end of each chapter. If the reader has a casual acquaintance with thermal radiation, it 
will be possible to understand all that is required in the text with the aid of the simulations and some thought. Outside 
reading is highly recommended but not absolutely necessary for this understanding. 
</p>

<p>
Micrometeorology is a complex and often mathematical science, however much of the subject can be appreciated without 
recourse to mathematics. For example, we all know that when the sun shines, the ground warms, puddles dry up, the winds 
become gusty, thermals form allowing birds to soar, grass and flowers grow. At night temperatures decrease, but remain 
higher in cloudy conditions, puddles don't dry up as easily and the winds are calmer. What is not so intuitively obvious 
though are the non-linear interactions between physical components. We are interested in the nature of these interactions 
rather than a description of its components for their own sake. To gain an initial understanding of the resultant behavior 
of a system we eschew confusing details and concentrate on the resultant effects.
</p>

<p>
It is our hope that this course will thus prove useful for the non-specialist and, more precisely, to those who are 
interested in studying problems involving interactions between the vegetation and the atmosphere. We want to avoid the 
deeply technical side of many questions because equations and jargon are digressive and often divide rather than unite. 
Accordingly, we will avoid discussions of such topics as "higher-order closure theory" or Monin- Obukhov static stability 
functions and try to use intuition where possible. To address such issues we must begin with some elementary concepts 
such as the surface energy balance. Our ultimate goal is to sharpen up one's intuition so that we may begin to answer 
such questions without recourse to a computer.
</p>

<a name="biosphere"></a>
<h2>Biosphere</h2>


<p>
Strictly speaking, the biosphere contains all living things and, as such, extends from deep 
inside the earth into the upper atmosphere. We will restrict the definition of the biosphere to 
the domain most immediately affected by vegetation; a layer extending from just inside the 
ground (the root zone; say a meter or two) up to a height somewhat above the vegetation canopy, 
say a few tens or hundreds of meters above the ground. As such, the biosphere is where we spend 
most of our time and so, is of direct importance to us. Although we will need to start the 
course with a general discussion of the driving force for land surface processes, the surface 
energy balance, we will later address questions concerning how plants modulate the land surface 
processes and thereby how they affect the biosphere.
</p>

<a name="feedback"></a>
<h2>Feedback Systems</h2>


<p>
<em>Feedback</em> is a word that will be used from time to time in this course. Feedback systems exist throughout
nature and are inherent in complex, non-linear systems.  The mathematical model upon which this course is based 
is highly non-linear and thus is able to capture a number of feedback processes found in nature.
</p>

<p>
Feedback is most often used in common language 
to describe the effect one encounters when sound 
from a speaker are fed back into the amplifier, 
leading to a sudden, high-pitched squeal that usually
 sends the person in charge of the sound system 
scrambling to change the volume setting and orientation 
of the speaker. A thermostat is an example of 
feedback produced by a servo-mechanism, which 
reduces the heat generated, say by a furnace, when
 the temperature reaches a certain preset level 
and it restarts the heating process when the temperature
 falls below the preset level. That type of feedback
 could be referred to as <em>negative feedback</em> because 
the effect of rising temperature is to counteract 
the rising temperature. Suppose the thermostat were 
set such that an increase in temperature created more
 heat output from a furnace. In that case the heating
 process would run away with itself and the room would 
become hotter and hotter. This is <em>called positive</em> 
feedback. Positive feedback is responsible for the
 squeal of sound in the speaker. Thus, negative feedback 
may nearly compensate for a reference input, reducing
 its effect on the output, and positive feedback amplifies
 the input.

<p>
We can illustrate the effect of feedback by Figure above. 
 Let's demonstrate the figure using a somewhat facetious 
example. Suppose that a dispute takes place in a bar 
room, perhaps produced by a fleeting glance by Mr. Look 
at the girl friend of Mr. Grouch, who begins to get very
 angry at the wayward glance. The feedback loop consists
 of a single transfer function G, representing the 
forward component. We could imagine an input R, which 
is the wayward glance, anger by Mr. Grouch, which is 
the feed forward control element G, and some result of
 this possible encounter C. Now, let's say that Mr. Look 
has a friend who is respected by Mr. Grouch; We'll call
 him Mr. Sooth. Mr. Sooth mediates the situation through
 an intervention denoted by the letter H. Thus, Mr. Grouch 
is calmed down somewhat by the effect of Mr. Sooth and the
 atmosphere returned to relative calm. This is a negative 
feedback situation, denoted by the feedback element B, 
which, in this case, has a negative sign. Now, suppose 
Mr. Grouch hated Mr. Sooth, so that the sound of Mr. 
Sooth's voice only made Mr. Grouch angrier. The result 
of intervention H would be a positive feedback (B 
positive), such that Mr. Grouch only becomes angrier
 by the intervention. Mr. Sooth does not take the hint
 but continues to ply Mr. Grouch with soft words which
 only make Mr. Grouch angrier. The result is a blow upâ€”a fight. 
</p>

<p>Only in extreme cases, however, does negative
 feedback entirely compensate for the input, although
 we will later present a case of feed forward in plants
 in which the input is actually reversed, not simply 
mitigated. In other examples (we hope you do not discover
 these in running the model) the effect may be a
 positive feedback leading to a blow up (mathematically 
speaking, a catastrophe) in the solution of the model.
 Some of these pitfalls may be lurking in this model,
 waiting for the user to choose just the right combination
 of input parameters. If this should happen, we advise 
the user to re-evaluate the input parameters or change
 them slightly. Sometimes, unwanted feedback may occur
 because the user has chosen unreasonable input parameters.
 In this case, the model's behavior should be a signal to 
the user that something is wrong in the initial conditions. 
</p>

<p>The mathematics of feedback systems can become very 
complex. We do not intend to delve into feedback 
processes in any more depth than we have done in 
discussing Mr. Grouch's problem. However, we will 
describe some rather interesting feedback processes in
 regard to plant regulation of their environment.
