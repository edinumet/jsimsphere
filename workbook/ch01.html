<h2>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 1</h2>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
This chapter addresses the issue of the surface energy balance. We begin with just a horizontal, bare soil surface 
and discuss the types of energy fluxes at the earth's surface as related to the absorbed solar energy, the nature of a 
flux, and the effect of the absorbed solar energy on the surface air temperature and the radiant temperature (in the 
thermal infrared) of the surface. We then ask what happens to these fluxes when the latitude is changed, the season is 
changed and the angle of slope and azimuth of that sloping surface is changed. Level 1 concludes with a series of 
simulations in which these parameters are varied and the output discussed. Level 2 addresses  such things as the total 
amount of solar energy absorbed as a function of latitude, when applied to real-world situations, such as the example of 
the ski slope. Further simulations are then suggested. A set of default input parameters is furnished. If no changes are 
made to these parameters, the simulations proceed using this input. Changes in the input parameters can therefore be 
assessed by comparing the output fields with those obtained with the default input parameters.
</p>
 
<p>
The purpose of this chapter is to develop a feel for the shape and magnitude of the turbulent fluxes (<em>i.e.</em>, the 
partitioning of the net radiation) over a relatively simple surface; that of bare soil.  This should be done for differing 
locations, time of year and altering topography.
</p>

<p>First, a word of caution. The expression 'all other things being equal' applies to these simulations. The purpose of 
using such a model is to pose simple questions that might be answered by making simple simulations. While the model is 
capable of capturing various feedback processes between differing components it can not answer all questions at once. For 
example, some simulations that you will make as part of this scenario are meant to show how the turbulent heat fluxes 
differ on different sides of a hillside <em>all other things being equal</em>. Although you may find more solar flux and more 
evapotranspiration on one side of a hillside than another, this flux will also depend on the soil moisture content, which 
is virtually fixed at the same value for all the simulations. In reality, greater solar flux on one side of a hill may 
cause that side of the hill to dry out more quickly, thereby resulting in less evapotranspiration than on the other side. 
Such an evapotranspiration differential could also lead to differing vegetation on the two sides of the hill. These 
vegetation differentials could, in turn, affect the evapotranspiration. On the other hand, the reduction of latent heat 
flux on that side of the hill my result in greater sensible heat flux and stronger updrafts that could enhance the 
precipitation on that side of the hill, thereby replenishing the soil water content depleted by the greater solar 
demand, etc. Obviously, these processes are not within the scope of the model and would require a full three-dimensional 
mesoscale model to capture all of the feedback mechanisms.
</p>

<a name="Balance"></a><strong><em>The Surface Energy Balance</em></strong>

<p>
Unlike the Federal budget, the surface energy budget must balance!  
Ignoring such trivial energy components such as 
friction, electrochemical interactions and photosynthesis, the remaining 
surface energy components - the net radiation 

<strong>R<small><sub>n</sub></small></strong>

, the latent heat flux 

<strong>L<sub><small>e</small></sub>E</strong>


, sensible heat flux <strong>H</strong> 
and soil heat flux <strong>G</strong>, <strong>should sum to zero</strong>. If we consider an infinitely thin 
plane, representing the surface, we can assume that the plane surface has effectively 
no storage, simply because it has no mass.  The balance for this hypothetical plane is 
shown in Figure 1.1.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="./working/ch01_files/1_002.gif" alt="figure 1.1">
</p>

<p>
A serious problem with the concept of the ground 
surface is that we have only to look about us to see that there is no planar ground surface: There are stretches of bare 
soil, but also crops, houses, trees, people, animals, cars, etc. The land surface is therefore a convenient artifact but 
it doesn't 'exist'.  In imagining that it does for computational purposes, we have created a 'model'.
</p>

<p>We will simply consider the ground surface, for the present, to be the layer over which the radiant energy from the sun 
is absorbed.  This layer will be a few millimeters thick for 'hard' surfaces, but may be meters thick in depth for still 
water or for that matter in a dense plant canopy. To deal with this vast difference in absorbing depth we will simply 
ignore water surfaces but we will eventually treat vegetation once the simple aspects of our model are explored.</p>
<p></p>


<a name="Albedo"></a>
<strong><em>Solar Radiation and Albedo</em></strong>

<p>We will also bypass, for the most part, the attenuation of radiant energy by the atmosphere and start by imagining a 
flux of solar radiant energy ('irradiance') on the imaginary planar ground surface.  Incident downward solar flux is given 
by the symbol 

<img src="ch01_files/sdown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="downward solar flux graphic"> 

and 
upward (reflected) solar flux at the ground surface by the symbol 
<img src="ch01_files/sup.gif" alt="equation" style="vertical-align: middle;">. The ratio of incident solar 
to reflected solar energy is called the 'albedo'; i.e. <img src="ch01_files/albedo.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="equation">. Albedo is a tricky concept - not only does it vary with 
surface type, but also with sun angle (even over vegetation). Values obtained from the literature for albedos of various 
surfaces may be misleading since they may or may not refer to that surface as a pure entity.  For instance, the albedo of 
some shiny leaves may be as high as 25%, although a canopy consisting entirely of that same plant may reflect much less 
than 25% of the incident solar flux because of internal reflections between leaves—the leaf absorbs 25% every time it 
is struck by a sunbeam so each successive bounce attenuates the original ray; (the atmosphere, too, may reflect energy 
back to the earth). Alternately stated, your shag-rug may have a lower albedo than that for individual fibers, or for a 
smooth rug made of the same material. We will also consider the surface to be 'Lambertian', which is to say that it 
reflects equally in all directions; in fact, reflected energy can be highly directional.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is often convenient (a key word in modeling) to consider the absorbed solar energy at the surface to 
be the incident solar flux multiplied by 1 - 

α<sub><small>0</small></sub>, where 



α<sub><small>0</small></sub> is the surface albedo; (here, we will ignore, for the present, 
back reflections from the atmosphere).</p>




<a name="Radiation"></a>
<strong><em>Long Wave Radiation</em></strong>

<p>Plank's law says that blackbody radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The ratio of emitted 
radiation for an object to the blackbody radiation is called the 'emissivity'. An emissivity for a surface is actually 
equal to the absorptivity of that surface, according to Kirchoff's rule, but it is also equal to one minus the 
reflectivity of the surface. Reflectivity is actually the same parameter as albedo, but we usually speak of the latter 
only in reference to solar reflectivity.  Since once minus the albedo is the absorptivity of a surface, one minus the 
emissivity also corresponds to an albedo, note though that the term albedo is usually reserved for the shorter (solar) 
wavelengths and emissivity for the longer (thermal) wavelengths.  For a surface in thermal equilibrium, absorptivity and 
emissivity are equivalent; this is an aspect of Kirchoff's law.</p>

      <p>Wein's law says that all bodies emit radiation at a wavelength inversely 
        proportional to temperature. Because the sun is very hot (about 10,000 
        K on the outer surface), the solar energy spectrum is at low wavelengths 
        (about 0.5 μ, which is close to the optimum sensitivity for the human 
        eye). Surfaces such as the earth emit radiation at wavelengths close to 
        10 μm, as is consistent with its lower temperature (about 300 K). The 
        symbol for this 'long wave' radiation is <img src="ch01_files/lup.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> 
        for upwelling long wave radiation. </p>

      <p>The atmosphere also emits thermal radiation because the atmosphere contains 
        gases that are good absorbers of long wave radiation. The higher concentration 
        of these gasses the greater when there are clouds because the emitting 
        surface, the cloud base (itself closely resembling a black body), may 
        be warmer than the average emitting temperature of the cloudless atmosphere. 
        The symbol for this downwelling thermal radiation as <img src="ch01_files/ldown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">.</p>

<strong><em>Net Radiation</em></strong>

      <p>After summing the absorbed solar radiant energy (by convention, positive), 
        the outgoing surface thermal irradiance (negative) and the downwelling 
        thermal irradiance (positive) we arrive at the net radiant energy (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 
        1.1</a>). This energy constitutes a key driver for heating the atmosphere 
        and the ground. Because the earth warms as the result of solar heating, 
        a temperature gradient develops between the surface and the substrate 
        below and the atmosphere above. According to the diffusion theory of heat 
        transfer, sensible heat (that which is used to change the temperature) 
        flows down the temperature gradient, either away from the earth (by definition, 
        positive in <a href="#equations">Eqn. 1.2</a>) or towards the earth. Thus, 
        at night the earth surface cools and the temperature gradient becomes 
        reversed. Heat flows downward toward the earth. The direction of the sensible 
        heat flux depends on the direction of the temperature gradient; (we will 
        ignore counter-gradient flows, such as occur as the result of convection 
        because resolution of this complication can only add unnecessary detail 
        without changing our basic premise, which is that of gradient flow. It 
        is best to remember, however, that the diffusive flow model is not always 
        valid in nature. (You might like to ponder why this is so.)</p>

<strong><em>The Representation of Fluxes</em></strong>

<p>The division of net radiation into turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor constitutes a central theme of this 
course.  We will usually express water vapor flux E (kg m<small><sup>-2</sup></small> s<small><sup>-1</sup></small>) as latent heat flux (the former multiplied by the latent 
heat of vaporization L<sub><small>e</small></sub>); this energy flux is designated by the symbol L<sub><small>e</small></sub>E. Fluxes represent the amount of <em>stuff</em> (say 
water molecules or energy) that moves through a unit area (say one meter square) per unit time (one second). A unit of 
energy is a Joule and the flux of energy is expressed as Joules per square meter per second or watts per square meter; 
(one watt equals one joule per second). Fluxes are usually driven by gradients (the change in a quantity per distance). 
For example, the flux of water vapor is driven by a change in water vapor concentration over some distance. Moisture 
gradients in the atmosphere are expressed in units of 'specific humidity' q or 'vapor pressure' e. Sensible heat fluxes 
are driven by differences in temperature. The ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux to latent heat flux is also 
an important parameter and is called the 'Bowen ratio' 
β.</p>

<p>Some of the radiant energy serves to evaporate liquid water in the soil.  Water vapor flux (or, alternately, latent 
heat flux), constitutes another component of the surface energy balance (by convention, positive upward).  In principle, 
water vapor can flow down the vapor gradient and therefore, on occasion, towards the surface. However, the earth's 
surface does not moisten as the result of downward flux of water vapor, nor does dew form directly as the result of 
downward latent heat flux; (if forms because air cools below the saturation temperature as the result of long wave 
emission to space).</p>

      <p>Except for the layer of air immediately in contact with the 'surface', the 
        atmospheric fluxes are accomplished by eddying motions, rather than by 
        the molecules. The efficiency of the atmospheric eddies (the eddy conductivity) 
        in conveying sensible heat and water vapor away or toward the surface 
        is very much greater than for molecular processes. The magnitude of these 
        fluxes depend both on the wind speed (the mechanical shear) and the intensity 
        of the heating (the convection); the total of which are limited by the 
        net radiation R<sub><small>n</small></sub>. In the case of heat and water 
        vapor flux, the origin of the fluxes is virtually at the surface. Immediately 
        adjacent to the surface turbulent eddies are relatively inefficient in 
        conveying heat or water vapor and, accordingly, both molecular and eddy 
        processes are co-equal in importance very close to the surface. This means 
        that the flow of sensible and latent heat must first pass through a layer 
        which is not very conducive to conducting it along.</p>

<p>Unlike heat and water vapor, the 'origin' for the flux of momentum from the air to the surface is above the surface 
at a fictitious level called the "roughness height" z<sub><small>o</small></sub>.  The roughness height reflects the irregularity of the surface 
and thus depends on the height and configuration of surrounding obstacles such as plants, buildings, etc.  Even the 
individual boundary layers of leaves well inside a plant canopy are affected by the turbulent effects of the wind above 
the canopy and therefore by the roughness height.</p>

<strong><em>Resistance and Conductance</em></strong>

<p>Without going into much detail we would like to introduce another couple of terms related to the way in which we can 
view heat and water vapor being transported from the surface to the atmosphere: These are the 'resistance' (r) and 
'conductance' (g). The resistance is simply defined as the ratio of the differential in the quantity being flux to the 
flux itself, <em>e.g.</em>, for sensible heat flux, H, which is driven by a temperature drop between two points, the resistance is
 defined as <img src="ch01_files/resistance.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Here the temperature drop is expressed not as a gradient, which is the ratio of the change in the 
quantity per unit distance, but simply as a change in temperature alone. We can think of a resistance as the parameter 
that regulates the flux of something—in this case sensible heat H—across the gap over which a gradient could be 
calculated if one knew the distance across an imaginary gap between two points, much as an electrical resistance 
regulates the flow of current (flux) across a voltage drop. Conductance is simply the inverse of the resistance.</p>

<p>Similarly, a resistance for latent heat flux is <img src="ch01_files/heatflux.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">.  Resistances customarily have the units of time per length 
(<em>e.g.</em>, s m<sup><small>-1</small></sup>).  Conductances have the inverse units, or that of a speed.  (Given these definitions, can you find the 
appropriate constants that allow resistance to have the units of s m<sup><small>-1</small></sup> for heat and for water vapor, given the atmospheric 
air density (kg per cubic meter), the latent heat of vaporization (Joules per gram) and the specific heat of dry air at 
constant pressure (Joules per kg per degree C?)</p>

<p>The concept of resistance comes from electrical circuit theory and was first proposed by Monteith (1975).  In this 
formulation, flux is analogous to the current <strong>i</strong> and the potential drop of specific humidity, temperature, etc. to the 
voltage drop <strong>V</strong>.  The flux equation <img src="ch01_files/fluxeqn.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> is analogous to the current equation <strong>V = i r</strong>, where V is the voltage, i the 
current and r the resistance. Within this conceptual framework it is possible to construct series and parallel resistors 
(and even elaborate bridge circuits) to represent fluxes in various systems, such as plants.  (It is even possible to 
represent capacitance as a storage term and thus to design RC circuits that depict fluxes through a system). Many plant 
scientists favor the conductance notation.  The advantage of resistance over conductance notation is that system can be 
treated mathematically in the same manner as electrical circuits. For example, in such a system resistances sum along a 
series; <em>e.g.</em>, the resistance to heat or moisture flux between the surface and 10 m above the surface as the sum of the 
resistances between the surface and 2 meters plus that between 2 meters and 10 meters.</p>

<p>Note, do not confuse conductance with 'conductivity', for instance, the thermal conductivity. Conductivity is defined 
in terms of a gradient whereas conductance is defined in terms of a potential drop Thus, the thermal conductivity, <img src="ch01_files/lambda.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, is 
defined as the ratio of the heat flux, say the ground heat flux G, divided by the temperature gradient i.e. <img src="ch01_files/tempgrad.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, whereas 
thermal conductance is the ratio of heat flux divided by the drop in temperature across some distance. The two terms, 
conductance and conductivity, are related, however; in this case the distance in question is 

Δz.  In calculating 
conductance or resistance in the atmosphere, a distance Δz. is implicit as the separation across the specific resistor. 
In subsequent discussion the subscript H will signify the resistance for heat flux and also for water vapor flux. </p>

<p>Resistances for water vapor and sensible heat flux are almost <strong>identical</strong> (within the error of measurement); 
accordingly, the Bowen ratio can be expressed in terms of the ratio <img src="ch01_files/bowen.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, where the delta quantities refer to 
differences in temperature and specific humidity in the vertical.  Since this ratio is proportional to the ratio of heat 
to water vapor flux, a Bowen ratio measurement, constituting a pair of temperature and specific humidity measurements on 
a vertical mast, can be used, in conjunction with the surface energy balance equation, to determine vertical fluxes of 
heat and water vapor. Indeed, the Bowen ratio approach is one of the principal means for measuring the fluxes in the 
field.  For elaboration upon this refer to the measurements section in Oke.</p>

<p>Resistances vary considerably with the amount of atmospheric turbulence (which itself depends on the sensible heat 
flux as well as on the roughness length and the wind speed); resistances to heat, water vapor and momentum tend to be 
lowest during midday and largest at night.  Can you think of a physical explanation for the variation of atmospheric 
resistance between day and night?</p>

<strong><em>Latitude and Seasonal Variations</em></strong>

<p>We have all observed that both the sun and the air are hottest during the middle of the day.  Yet the air is not 
directly heated by the sun.  Most of the sun's energy reaches the ground where, in the form of radiant energy, it is 
either reflected or emitted back to space or, in the form of heat energy, it is either stored (temporarily) in the 
ground or transferred back to the atmosphere in the form of latent or sensible heat fluxes. Over the ocean the ambient 
air temperature hardly varies by more than a fraction of a degree centigrade (or if you wish to be truly American 
Fahrenheit) during the day and may actually be warmer at night in some instances.  Let us then investigate this diurnal 
behavior of a net radiation and surface temperature, as well as the surface energy fluxes.</p>

<strong><em>The Effect of Terrain Slope, Solar Elevation, and Azimuth</em></strong>

<p>Take a flashlight and aim it directly toward the earth.  The beam makes a roundish spot on the ground.  Rotate the 
flashlight toward the horizon, so that the spot becomes broader and finally disappears as the light is made horizontal.  
Shine that same flashlight horizontally but perpendicularly at a horizontal wall and the illuminated spot reappears. 
Rotate the light horizontally so that the angle of the beam with the wall, initially 90°, changes. Once again the spot 
increases in area.</p>

<p>The analog of the flashlight holds for the sun's direct beam, which illuminates a larger area the lower the sun 
above the horizon; the diffuse (or scattered) part of the beam comes form all angles and the absorbed part, of course, 
disappears. Late (or early) in the day, or even at noon in northern latitudes (in the northern hemisphere), especially 
in winter, the sun's beam makes a small angle (the elevation angle) with the horizontal.  A sloping surface that happens 
to make a 90° angle with the sun's beam will experience direct sunlight resembling that for solar noon 
(sun directly above).  Of course, the sun must still shine through a greater depth of the atmosphere than for the case 
of an overhead sun, so a nearly vertical wall oriented perpendicularly to the sun near dawn on a winter's day still won't 
receive the amount of solar radiation equivalent to the tropics; a greater amount of energy would have been scattered and 
absorbed as the beam passes through the greater atmospheric depth. This is illustrated in figures 1.1 and 1.2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch01_files/1.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>
Since the sun tends to remain in the southern half of the sky at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere (except for 
near dawn and dusk, when it is located in the northeast or northwest), ground slopes facing the south (orientation 0° 
azimuth in the model) will receive more sunlight than those facing north.  Similarly, slopes facing east will receive 
more sun in the morning than in the afternoon, and vice-versa for the west.  You can invent other scenarios.  In 
general, up to a point, the greater the slope the greater the difference from a horizontal ground surface.  (Can you 
intuit approximately at what elevation angle would a south-facing slope receive the greatest direct sunlight for a sun 
40° above the horizon?)</p>



<p>Clearly, both the 'elevation angle' and the 'azimuth angle' of the terrain are important parameters in determining 
the amount of solar energy received on a horizontal surface.  In our simulations we will take zero degrees of azimuth 
(aspect) when facing south and 180 degrees of azimuth when facing north. This definition also suits meteorologists who 
define a north wind as that which comes from the north (zero degrees). So also is the sun's elevation angle because 
that affects the amount of solar energy attenuated from the beam.</p>

<a name="simulations"></a> <h2>Simulations</h2>



<a name="Ser1"></a>
<em>Simulation series 1</em> 

<ul>
<li><strong>Run Control Simulation with Default parameters</strong>
<p>Let us take things one step at a time and use the default conditions over a mid latitude site during August at about 
latitude 40° N (specifically 39.25 N latitude in Kansas). The object is to produce a 
simulation for the case of bare soil 
and clear skies. Important output parameters to concentrate on are the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the net 
radiation. We will also look at the surface radiant and air temperatures, which are at 'screen'-level elevation (1.5 m) 
or at 50 m elevation above the ground. As we have said, the surface is somewhat of an abstraction. However, all 
elevations are with respect to local ground level. Temperatures, however, are expressed as potential temperatures in 
order so that we can compare its values at different elevations. The exception to this rule is the radiant surface 
temperature and the ground temperatures which remain as an ordinary temperature. However, differences in potential 
temperature between the surface and 10 meters above the surface can be considered as negligible.
</p>
<p>
Run a simulation first with the conditions provided in the default input data file. Plot the surface air temperature 
(say at 50 or 10 m), the sensible and the latent heat fluxes and the net radiation. 
</p>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the maximum fluxes occur close to local noon, with the latent heat flux lagging slightly the net 
radiation. Note that the surface air temperature lags still further, reaching a maximum after 1300 h.  Note further that 
the heat flux into the ground reaches a maximum during the morning hours and actually becomes negative (upward) during 
the late afternoon. Sensible heat flux becomes negative during the evening as latent heat flux vanishes. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Recalling our reference to fluxes being driven by changes in a quantity such as temperature, can you provide a 
physical explanation for the negative sensible heat flux? (Hint: sensible heat flux tends to be directed down the 
temperature gradient, from higher to lower temperatures.) </li>
<li>Why should the air temperature lag the radiant surface temperature? (Hint: recall that the ocean temperatures 
tend to lag the land temperatures. Could this be due to a difference in heat storage?)</li>
<li>Realizing that the heat flux into the ground is also proportional to the vertical gradient of temperature just 
below the surface, can you explain why the ground flux is a maximum in the morning? What do you suppose is happening 
to the vertical temperature gradient in the ground with time and why? (Hint: plot the temperature of the ground (one 
level below the surface) and the radiant surface temperature.)</li>
</ol>



<a name="Ser2"></a>
<em>Simulation series  2</em>

<ul>

<li><strong>Change latitude and/or date</strong>
<p>Now make some additional simulations changing only the latitude (to 20° and then to 60° N) 
and the date from August to 
October. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the lower and higher latitude fluxes by plotting both on the same graph. What are the main differences 
between these various simulations in the fluxes and in the surface temperature and why?  (There are some small but 
puzzling differences in the simulations, such as the times at which fluxes maximize. You may discover some interesting 
features in the fluxes and temperatures that we did not anticipate. Not everything can be explained readily, however.) 
Hint: look again at Figures 1.1 and 1.2.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Ser3"></a>
<em>Simulation series 3</em>

<ul>

<li><strong>Run simulation with slope of 20%, comparing either north-, south-, east- or west-facing slopes with the default 
(zero slope).</strong>
<p>Return to the default conditions for simulation #1. Now examine the slope effect with the model by varying the .
terrain slope and azimuth.  This is done by specifying the azimuth and elevation angles for a hypothetical area of 
ground surface surrounding the point at which the computations apply. The imaginary surface area may tilt upward toward 
the north at a slope of 20%. By comparison, it is rare to encounter a road with a slope greater than 15%. Note the 
diurnal variation in surface temperature, surface energy fluxes and net radiation. Note how the relevant model 
parameters behave in response to differing slope angles, latitude and time of year. Note the early morning and late 
afternoon fluxes and temperature and compare with the control run. Do you find anything surprising here?

</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>At what time is the solar flux and the net radiation flux maximized for the different azimuth angles? How do 
radiation sunset and solar sunset vary with azimuth angle?</li>
<li>At what times of day is the solar flux stronger for the north-facing versus south-facing slopes? How about the 
east-facing versus the west-facing slopes. Are these differences reflected in the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the 
air temperatures?</li>
</ol>

<p>
<strong>Level 2</strong>
</p>

<p>Feel free to experiment with more than just these simulations. Learn to identify the important and relevant 
differences between the default run and the other simulations and to recognize the significant implications of these 
results, which may even be counter intuitive. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Consider the optimal slope direction and angle to build a ski resort on what combination of factors would allow the 
least direct solar radiation and total solar radation on the slopes for a given latitude. Would it be cheaper, assuming 
the more solar radiation that reaches the slope results in more snowblowing costs, to have a resot in a souch-fcing 
slope at 50° latitude versus a north-south slope at 40° latitude? Are there advantages/disadvantages to having a 
northeast versus a northwest slope?  You might also want to consider the air temperature differences using a winter 
sounding from the sounding library.</li> 
<li>You are an architect building a new home in Buffalo, NY. You decide to include some windows on the north side of 
the roof and you want sunlight to strike these wondows as much as possible since they are above the kiethen. If these 
windows were placed on a 20 degree slope (that of the roof), how much net radiation would strike the windows on this 
side of the house? Let's say that you also want a fairly steep roof because of the high snowfall, typical for Buffalo. 
You could make the angle of the roof greater than 20 degrees (say 50 degrees). What would be a good angle to choose in 
this new home that might constitute a good compromise to allow the maximum sunlight on the windows and the optimum roof 
slope for allowing snow to slide off of it?</li>

<h2>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 1</h2>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h3>Introduction</h3>


<p>
This chapter addresses the issue of the surface energy balance. We begin with just a horizontal, bare soil surface 
and discuss the types of energy fluxes at the earth's surface as related to the absorbed solar energy, the nature of a 
flux, and the effect of the absorbed solar energy on the surface air temperature and the radiant temperature (in the 
thermal infrared) of the surface. We then ask what happens to these fluxes when the latitude is changed, the season is 
changed and the angle of slope and azimuth of that sloping surface is changed. Level 1 concludes with a series of 
simulations in which these parameters are varied and the output discussed. Level 2 addresses  such things as the total 
amount of solar energy absorbed as a function of latitude, when applied to real-world situations, such as the example of 
the ski slope. Further simulations are then suggested. A set of default input parameters is furnished. If no changes are 
made to these parameters, the simulations proceed using this input. Changes in the input parameters can therefore be 
assessed by comparing the output fields with those obtained with the default input parameters.
</p>
 
<p>
The purpose of this chapter is to develop a feel for the shape and magnitude of the turbulent fluxes (<em>i.e.</em>, the 
partitioning of the net radiation) over a relatively simple surface; that of bare soil.  This should be done for differing 
locations, time of year and altering topography.
</p>

<p>First, a word of caution. The expression 'all other things being equal' applies to these simulations. The purpose of 
using such a model is to pose simple questions that might be answered by making simple simulations. While the model is 
capable of capturing various feedback processes between differing components it can not answer all questions at once. For 
example, some simulations that you will make as part of this scenario are meant to show how the turbulent heat fluxes 
differ on different sides of a hillside <em>all other things being equal</em>. Although you may find more solar flux and more 
evapotranspiration on one side of a hillside than another, this flux will also depend on the soil moisture content, which 
is virtually fixed at the same value for all the simulations. In reality, greater solar flux on one side of a hill may 
cause that side of the hill to dry out more quickly, thereby resulting in less evapotranspiration than on the other side. 
Such an evapotranspiration differential could also lead to differing vegetation on the two sides of the hill. These 
vegetation differentials could, in turn, affect the evapotranspiration. On the other hand, the reduction of latent heat 
flux on that side of the hill my result in greater sensible heat flux and stronger updrafts that could enhance the 
precipitation on that side of the hill, thereby replenishing the soil water content depleted by the greater solar 
demand, etc. Obviously, these processes are not within the scope of the model and would require a full three-dimensional 
mesoscale model to capture all of the feedback mechanisms.
</p>

<a name="Balance"></a><strong><em>The Surface Energy Balance</em></strong>

<p>
Unlike the Federal budget, the surface energy budget must balance!  
Ignoring such trivial energy components such as 
friction, electrochemical interactions and photosynthesis, the remaining 
surface energy components - the net radiation 

<strong>R<small><sub>n</sub></small></strong>

, the latent heat flux 

<strong>L<sub><small>e</small></sub>E</strong>


, sensible heat flux <strong>H</strong> 
and soil heat flux <strong>G</strong>, <strong>should sum to zero</strong>. If we consider an infinitely thin 
plane, representing the surface, we can assume that the plane surface has effectively 
no storage, simply because it has no mass.  The balance for this hypothetical plane is 
shown in Figure 1.1.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="./working/ch01_files/1_002.gif" alt="figure 1.1">
</p>

<p>
A serious problem with the concept of the ground 
surface is that we have only to look about us to see that there is no planar ground surface: There are stretches of bare 
soil, but also crops, houses, trees, people, animals, cars, etc. The land surface is therefore a convenient artifact but 
it doesn't 'exist'.  In imagining that it does for computational purposes, we have created a 'model'.
</p>

<p>We will simply consider the ground surface, for the present, to be the layer over which the radiant energy from the sun 
is absorbed.  This layer will be a few millimeters thick for 'hard' surfaces, but may be meters thick in depth for still 
water or for that matter in a dense plant canopy. To deal with this vast difference in absorbing depth we will simply 
ignore water surfaces but we will eventually treat vegetation once the simple aspects of our model are explored.</p>
<p></p>


<a name="Albedo"></a>
<strong><em>Solar Radiation and Albedo</em></strong>

<p>We will also bypass, for the most part, the attenuation of radiant energy by the atmosphere and start by imagining a 
flux of solar radiant energy ('irradiance') on the imaginary planar ground surface.  Incident downward solar flux is given 
by the symbol 

<img src="ch01_files/sdown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="downward solar flux graphic"> 

and 
upward (reflected) solar flux at the ground surface by the symbol 
<img src="ch01_files/sup.gif" alt="equation" style="vertical-align: middle;">. The ratio of incident solar 
to reflected solar energy is called the 'albedo'; i.e. <img src="ch01_files/albedo.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="equation">. Albedo is a tricky concept - not only does it vary with 
surface type, but also with sun angle (even over vegetation). Values obtained from the literature for albedos of various 
surfaces may be misleading since they may or may not refer to that surface as a pure entity.  For instance, the albedo of 
some shiny leaves may be as high as 25%, although a canopy consisting entirely of that same plant may reflect much less 
than 25% of the incident solar flux because of internal reflections between leaves—the leaf absorbs 25% every time it 
is struck by a sunbeam so each successive bounce attenuates the original ray; (the atmosphere, too, may reflect energy 
back to the earth). Alternately stated, your shag-rug may have a lower albedo than that for individual fibers, or for a 
smooth rug made of the same material. We will also consider the surface to be 'Lambertian', which is to say that it 
reflects equally in all directions; in fact, reflected energy can be highly directional.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is often convenient (a key word in modeling) to consider the absorbed solar energy at the surface to 
be the incident solar flux multiplied by 1 - 

α<sub><small>0</small></sub>, where 



α<sub><small>0</small></sub> is the surface albedo; (here, we will ignore, for the present, 
back reflections from the atmosphere).</p>




<a name="Radiation"></a>
<strong><em>Long Wave Radiation</em></strong>

<p>Plank's law says that blackbody radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The ratio of emitted 
radiation for an object to the blackbody radiation is called the 'emissivity'. An emissivity for a surface is actually 
equal to the absorptivity of that surface, according to Kirchoff's rule, but it is also equal to one minus the 
reflectivity of the surface. Reflectivity is actually the same parameter as albedo, but we usually speak of the latter 
only in reference to solar reflectivity.  Since once minus the albedo is the absorptivity of a surface, one minus the 
emissivity also corresponds to an albedo, note though that the term albedo is usually reserved for the shorter (solar) 
wavelengths and emissivity for the longer (thermal) wavelengths.  For a surface in thermal equilibrium, absorptivity and 
emissivity are equivalent; this is an aspect of Kirchoff's law.</p>

      <p>Wein's law says that all bodies emit radiation at a wavelength inversely 
        proportional to temperature. Because the sun is very hot (about 10,000 
        K on the outer surface), the solar energy spectrum is at low wavelengths 
        (about 0.5 μ, which is close to the optimum sensitivity for the human 
        eye). Surfaces such as the earth emit radiation at wavelengths close to 
        10 μm, as is consistent with its lower temperature (about 300 K). The 
        symbol for this 'long wave' radiation is <img src="ch01_files/lup.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> 
        for upwelling long wave radiation. </p>

      <p>The atmosphere also emits thermal radiation because the atmosphere contains 
        gases that are good absorbers of long wave radiation. The higher concentration 
        of these gasses the greater when there are clouds because the emitting 
        surface, the cloud base (itself closely resembling a black body), may 
        be warmer than the average emitting temperature of the cloudless atmosphere. 
        The symbol for this downwelling thermal radiation as <img src="ch01_files/ldown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">.</p>

<strong><em>Net Radiation</em></strong>

      <p>After summing the absorbed solar radiant energy (by convention, positive), 
        the outgoing surface thermal irradiance (negative) and the downwelling 
        thermal irradiance (positive) we arrive at the net radiant energy (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 
        1.1</a>). This energy constitutes a key driver for heating the atmosphere 
        and the ground. Because the earth warms as the result of solar heating, 
        a temperature gradient develops between the surface and the substrate 
        below and the atmosphere above. According to the diffusion theory of heat 
        transfer, sensible heat (that which is used to change the temperature) 
        flows down the temperature gradient, either away from the earth (by definition, 
        positive in <a href="#equations">Eqn. 1.2</a>) or towards the earth. Thus, 
        at night the earth surface cools and the temperature gradient becomes 
        reversed. Heat flows downward toward the earth. The direction of the sensible 
        heat flux depends on the direction of the temperature gradient; (we will 
        ignore counter-gradient flows, such as occur as the result of convection 
        because resolution of this complication can only add unnecessary detail 
        without changing our basic premise, which is that of gradient flow. It 
        is best to remember, however, that the diffusive flow model is not always 
        valid in nature. (You might like to ponder why this is so.)</p>

<strong><em>The Representation of Fluxes</em></strong>

<p>The division of net radiation into turbulent fluxes of heat and water vapor constitutes a central theme of this 
course.  We will usually express water vapor flux E (kg m<small><sup>-2</sup></small> s<small><sup>-1</sup></small>) as latent heat flux (the former multiplied by the latent 
heat of vaporization L<sub><small>e</small></sub>); this energy flux is designated by the symbol L<sub><small>e</small></sub>E. Fluxes represent the amount of <em>stuff</em> (say 
water molecules or energy) that moves through a unit area (say one meter square) per unit time (one second). A unit of 
energy is a Joule and the flux of energy is expressed as Joules per square meter per second or watts per square meter; 
(one watt equals one joule per second). Fluxes are usually driven by gradients (the change in a quantity per distance). 
For example, the flux of water vapor is driven by a change in water vapor concentration over some distance. Moisture 
gradients in the atmosphere are expressed in units of 'specific humidity' q or 'vapor pressure' e. Sensible heat fluxes 
are driven by differences in temperature. The ratio of sensible heat flux to latent heat flux to latent heat flux is also 
an important parameter and is called the 'Bowen ratio' 
β.</p>

<p>Some of the radiant energy serves to evaporate liquid water in the soil.  Water vapor flux (or, alternately, latent 
heat flux), constitutes another component of the surface energy balance (by convention, positive upward).  In principle, 
water vapor can flow down the vapor gradient and therefore, on occasion, towards the surface. However, the earth's 
surface does not moisten as the result of downward flux of water vapor, nor does dew form directly as the result of 
downward latent heat flux; (if forms because air cools below the saturation temperature as the result of long wave 
emission to space).</p>

      <p>Except for the layer of air immediately in contact with the 'surface', the 
        atmospheric fluxes are accomplished by eddying motions, rather than by 
        the molecules. The efficiency of the atmospheric eddies (the eddy conductivity) 
        in conveying sensible heat and water vapor away or toward the surface 
        is very much greater than for molecular processes. The magnitude of these 
        fluxes depend both on the wind speed (the mechanical shear) and the intensity 
        of the heating (the convection); the total of which are limited by the 
        net radiation R<sub><small>n</small></sub>. In the case of heat and water 
        vapor flux, the origin of the fluxes is virtually at the surface. Immediately 
        adjacent to the surface turbulent eddies are relatively inefficient in 
        conveying heat or water vapor and, accordingly, both molecular and eddy 
        processes are co-equal in importance very close to the surface. This means 
        that the flow of sensible and latent heat must first pass through a layer 
        which is not very conducive to conducting it along.</p>

<p>Unlike heat and water vapor, the 'origin' for the flux of momentum from the air to the surface is above the surface 
at a fictitious level called the "roughness height" z<sub><small>o</small></sub>.  The roughness height reflects the irregularity of the surface 
and thus depends on the height and configuration of surrounding obstacles such as plants, buildings, etc.  Even the 
individual boundary layers of leaves well inside a plant canopy are affected by the turbulent effects of the wind above 
the canopy and therefore by the roughness height.</p>

<strong><em>Resistance and Conductance</em></strong>

<p>Without going into much detail we would like to introduce another couple of terms related to the way in which we can 
view heat and water vapor being transported from the surface to the atmosphere: These are the 'resistance' (r) and 
'conductance' (g). The resistance is simply defined as the ratio of the differential in the quantity being flux to the 
flux itself, <em>e.g.</em>, for sensible heat flux, H, which is driven by a temperature drop between two points, the resistance is
 defined as <img src="ch01_files/resistance.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Here the temperature drop is expressed not as a gradient, which is the ratio of the change in the 
quantity per unit distance, but simply as a change in temperature alone. We can think of a resistance as the parameter 
that regulates the flux of something—in this case sensible heat H—across the gap over which a gradient could be 
calculated if one knew the distance across an imaginary gap between two points, much as an electrical resistance 
regulates the flow of current (flux) across a voltage drop. Conductance is simply the inverse of the resistance.</p>

<p>Similarly, a resistance for latent heat flux is <img src="ch01_files/heatflux.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">.  Resistances customarily have the units of time per length 
(<em>e.g.</em>, s m<sup><small>-1</small></sup>).  Conductances have the inverse units, or that of a speed.  (Given these definitions, can you find the 
appropriate constants that allow resistance to have the units of s m<sup><small>-1</small></sup> for heat and for water vapor, given the atmospheric 
air density (kg per cubic meter), the latent heat of vaporization (Joules per gram) and the specific heat of dry air at 
constant pressure (Joules per kg per degree C?)</p>

<p>The concept of resistance comes from electrical circuit theory and was first proposed by Monteith (1975).  In this 
formulation, flux is analogous to the current <strong>i</strong> and the potential drop of specific humidity, temperature, etc. to the 
voltage drop <strong>V</strong>.  The flux equation <img src="ch01_files/fluxeqn.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> is analogous to the current equation <strong>V = i r</strong>, where V is the voltage, i the 
current and r the resistance. Within this conceptual framework it is possible to construct series and parallel resistors 
(and even elaborate bridge circuits) to represent fluxes in various systems, such as plants.  (It is even possible to 
represent capacitance as a storage term and thus to design RC circuits that depict fluxes through a system). Many plant 
scientists favor the conductance notation.  The advantage of resistance over conductance notation is that system can be 
treated mathematically in the same manner as electrical circuits. For example, in such a system resistances sum along a 
series; <em>e.g.</em>, the resistance to heat or moisture flux between the surface and 10 m above the surface as the sum of the 
resistances between the surface and 2 meters plus that between 2 meters and 10 meters.</p>

<p>Note, do not confuse conductance with 'conductivity', for instance, the thermal conductivity. Conductivity is defined 
in terms of a gradient whereas conductance is defined in terms of a potential drop Thus, the thermal conductivity, <img src="ch01_files/lambda.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, is 
defined as the ratio of the heat flux, say the ground heat flux G, divided by the temperature gradient i.e. <img src="ch01_files/tempgrad.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, whereas 
thermal conductance is the ratio of heat flux divided by the drop in temperature across some distance. The two terms, 
conductance and conductivity, are related, however; in this case the distance in question is 

Δz.  In calculating 
conductance or resistance in the atmosphere, a distance Δz. is implicit as the separation across the specific resistor. 
In subsequent discussion the subscript H will signify the resistance for heat flux and also for water vapor flux. </p>

<p>Resistances for water vapor and sensible heat flux are almost <strong>identical</strong> (within the error of measurement); 
accordingly, the Bowen ratio can be expressed in terms of the ratio <img src="ch01_files/bowen.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, where the delta quantities refer to 
differences in temperature and specific humidity in the vertical.  Since this ratio is proportional to the ratio of heat 
to water vapor flux, a Bowen ratio measurement, constituting a pair of temperature and specific humidity measurements on 
a vertical mast, can be used, in conjunction with the surface energy balance equation, to determine vertical fluxes of 
heat and water vapor. Indeed, the Bowen ratio approach is one of the principal means for measuring the fluxes in the 
field.  For elaboration upon this refer to the measurements section in Oke.</p>

<p>Resistances vary considerably with the amount of atmospheric turbulence (which itself depends on the sensible heat 
flux as well as on the roughness length and the wind speed); resistances to heat, water vapor and momentum tend to be 
lowest during midday and largest at night.  Can you think of a physical explanation for the variation of atmospheric 
resistance between day and night?</p>

<strong><em>Latitude and Seasonal Variations</em></strong>

<p>We have all observed that both the sun and the air are hottest during the middle of the day.  Yet the air is not 
directly heated by the sun.  Most of the sun's energy reaches the ground where, in the form of radiant energy, it is 
either reflected or emitted back to space or, in the form of heat energy, it is either stored (temporarily) in the 
ground or transferred back to the atmosphere in the form of latent or sensible heat fluxes. Over the ocean the ambient 
air temperature hardly varies by more than a fraction of a degree centigrade (or if you wish to be truly American 
Fahrenheit) during the day and may actually be warmer at night in some instances.  Let us then investigate this diurnal 
behavior of a net radiation and surface temperature, as well as the surface energy fluxes.</p>

<strong><em>The Effect of Terrain Slope, Solar Elevation, and Azimuth</em></strong>

<p>Take a flashlight and aim it directly toward the earth.  The beam makes a roundish spot on the ground.  Rotate the 
flashlight toward the horizon, so that the spot becomes broader and finally disappears as the light is made horizontal.  
Shine that same flashlight horizontally but perpendicularly at a horizontal wall and the illuminated spot reappears. 
Rotate the light horizontally so that the angle of the beam with the wall, initially 90°, changes. Once again the spot 
increases in area.</p>

<p>The analog of the flashlight holds for the sun's direct beam, which illuminates a larger area the lower the sun 
above the horizon; the diffuse (or scattered) part of the beam comes form all angles and the absorbed part, of course, 
disappears. Late (or early) in the day, or even at noon in northern latitudes (in the northern hemisphere), especially 
in winter, the sun's beam makes a small angle (the elevation angle) with the horizontal.  A sloping surface that happens 
to make a 90° angle with the sun's beam will experience direct sunlight resembling that for solar noon 
(sun directly above).  Of course, the sun must still shine through a greater depth of the atmosphere than for the case 
of an overhead sun, so a nearly vertical wall oriented perpendicularly to the sun near dawn on a winter's day still won't 
receive the amount of solar radiation equivalent to the tropics; a greater amount of energy would have been scattered and 
absorbed as the beam passes through the greater atmospheric depth. This is illustrated in figures 1.1 and 1.2.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch01_files/1.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>
Since the sun tends to remain in the southern half of the sky at mid-latitudes in the northern hemisphere (except for 
near dawn and dusk, when it is located in the northeast or northwest), ground slopes facing the south (orientation 0° 
azimuth in the model) will receive more sunlight than those facing north.  Similarly, slopes facing east will receive 
more sun in the morning than in the afternoon, and vice-versa for the west.  You can invent other scenarios.  In 
general, up to a point, the greater the slope the greater the difference from a horizontal ground surface.  (Can you 
intuit approximately at what elevation angle would a south-facing slope receive the greatest direct sunlight for a sun 
40° above the horizon?)</p>



<p>Clearly, both the 'elevation angle' and the 'azimuth angle' of the terrain are important parameters in determining 
the amount of solar energy received on a horizontal surface.  In our simulations we will take zero degrees of azimuth 
(aspect) when facing south and 180 degrees of azimuth when facing north. This definition also suits meteorologists who 
define a north wind as that which comes from the north (zero degrees). So also is the sun's elevation angle because 
that affects the amount of solar energy attenuated from the beam.</p>

<a name="Ser1"></a>
<em>Simulation series 1</em> 

<ul>
<li><strong>Run Control Simulation with Default parameters</strong>
<p>Let us take things one step at a time and use the default conditions over a mid latitude site during August at about 
latitude 40° N (specifically 39.25 N latitude in Kansas). The object is to produce a 
simulation for the case of bare soil 
and clear skies. Important output parameters to concentrate on are the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the net 
radiation. We will also look at the surface radiant and air temperatures, which are at 'screen'-level elevation (1.5 m) 
or at 50 m elevation above the ground. As we have said, the surface is somewhat of an abstraction. However, all 
elevations are with respect to local ground level. Temperatures, however, are expressed as potential temperatures in 
order so that we can compare its values at different elevations. The exception to this rule is the radiant surface 
temperature and the ground temperatures which remain as an ordinary temperature. However, differences in potential 
temperature between the surface and 10 meters above the surface can be considered as negligible.
</p>
<p>
Run a simulation first with the conditions provided in the default input data file. Plot the surface air temperature 
(say at 50 or 10 m), the sensible and the latent heat fluxes and the net radiation. 
</p>
<p>
Not surprisingly, the maximum fluxes occur close to local noon, with the latent heat flux lagging slightly the net 
radiation. Note that the surface air temperature lags still further, reaching a maximum after 1300 h.  Note further that 
the heat flux into the ground reaches a maximum during the morning hours and actually becomes negative (upward) during 
the late afternoon. Sensible heat flux becomes negative during the evening as latent heat flux vanishes. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Recalling our reference to fluxes being driven by changes in a quantity such as temperature, can you provide a 
physical explanation for the negative sensible heat flux? (Hint: sensible heat flux tends to be directed down the 
temperature gradient, from higher to lower temperatures.) </li>
<li>Why should the air temperature lag the radiant surface temperature? (Hint: recall that the ocean temperatures 
tend to lag the land temperatures. Could this be due to a difference in heat storage?)</li>
<li>Realizing that the heat flux into the ground is also proportional to the vertical gradient of temperature just 
below the surface, can you explain why the ground flux is a maximum in the morning? What do you suppose is happening 
to the vertical temperature gradient in the ground with time and why? (Hint: plot the temperature of the ground (one 
level below the surface) and the radiant surface temperature.)</li>
</ol>



<a name="Ser2"></a>
<em>Simulation series  2</em>

<ul>

<li><strong>Change latitude and/or date</strong>
<p>Now make some additional simulations changing only the latitude (to 20° and then to 60° N) 
and the date from August to 
October. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Compare the lower and higher latitude fluxes by plotting both on the same graph. What are the main differences 
between these various simulations in the fluxes and in the surface temperature and why?  (There are some small but 
puzzling differences in the simulations, such as the times at which fluxes maximize. You may discover some interesting 
features in the fluxes and temperatures that we did not anticipate. Not everything can be explained readily, however.) 
Hint: look again at Figures 1.1 and 1.2.</li>
</ol>

<a name="Ser3"></a>
<em>Simulation series 3</em>

<ul>

<li><strong>Run simulation with slope of 20%, comparing either north-, south-, east- or west-facing slopes with the default 
(zero slope).</strong>
<p>Return to the default conditions for simulation #1. Now examine the slope effect with the model by varying the .
terrain slope and azimuth.  This is done by specifying the azimuth and elevation angles for a hypothetical area of 
ground surface surrounding the point at which the computations apply. The imaginary surface area may tilt upward toward 
the north at a slope of 20%. By comparison, it is rare to encounter a road with a slope greater than 15%. Note the 
diurnal variation in surface temperature, surface energy fluxes and net radiation. Note how the relevant model 
parameters behave in response to differing slope angles, latitude and time of year. Note the early morning and late 
afternoon fluxes and temperature and compare with the control run. Do you find anything surprising here?
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>At what time is the solar flux and the net radiation flux maximized for the different azimuth angles? How do 
radiation sunset and solar sunset vary with azimuth angle?</li>
<li>At what times of day is the solar flux stronger for the north-facing versus south-facing slopes? How about the 
east-facing versus the west-facing slopes. Are these differences reflected in the sensible and latent heat fluxes and the 
air temperatures?</li>
</ol>

<a name="Sim2"></a>
<p>
<strong>Level 2</strong>
</p>

<p>Feel free to experiment with more than just these simulations. Learn to identify the important and relevant 
differences between the default run and the other simulations and to recognize the significant implications of these 
results, which may even be counter intuitive. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Consider the optimal slope direction and angle to build a ski resort on what combination of factors would allow the 
least direct solar radiation and total solar radation on the slopes for a given latitude. Would it be cheaper, assuming 
the more solar radiation that reaches the slope results in more snowblowing costs, to have a resot in a souch-fcing 
slope at 50° latitude versus a north-south slope at 40° latitude? Are there advantages/disadvantages to having a 
northeast versus a northwest slope?  You might also want to consider the air temperature differences using a winter 
sounding from the sounding library.</li> 
<li>You are an architect building a new home in Buffalo, NY. You decide to include some windows on the north side of 
the roof and you want sunlight to strike these wondows as much as possible since they are above the kiethen. If these 
windows were placed on a 20 degree slope (that of the roof), how much net radiation would strike the windows on this 
side of the house? Let's say that you also want a fairly steep roof because of the high snowfall, typical for Buffalo. 
You could make the angle of the roof greater than 20 degrees (say 50 degrees). What would be a good angle to choose in 
this new home that might constitute a good compromise to allow the maximum sunlight on the windows and the optimum roof 
slope for allowing snow to slide off of it?</li>
