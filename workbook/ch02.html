<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 2</h1>
<a name="introduction"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
A well-known radical, anti-war organization during the 1960's was known as the "Weathermen," so called
because, it claimed to know which way the wind as blowing; (it evidently didn't know which way the wind
was blowing enough to have the foresight to call themselves Weatherpersons.) In this session we will
endeavor to become more astute Weatherpersons (whether you like it or not!) by finding out what parameters
affect the wind speed and how wind speed influences the surface energy fluxes and the surface temperature.
Obviously, the initialized wind speeds themselves govern the wind speeds, although the latter can evolve
during the simulation. The purpose of this chapter, therefore, is to explore the effects of wind speed
on surface radiant and air temperatures and the surface energy fluxes.
</p>

<a name="background"></a> <h2>Background</h2>

<p>
First, ask yourself the following questions: Would you expect the
sensible heat flux (and, for that matter, the latent heat flux) to
increase or decrease with
increasing wind speed? How about the surface temperature? To answer
this question, first consider the concept of atmospheric resistance.
Away from hard
surfaces (where molecular processes dominate the flux of heat across
the air interface directly in contact with that surface), the
atmospheric resistance is related to
the efficiency of turbulent eddies to carry away the heat and water
vapor; refer to <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2 and 2.3</a>.
Would you expect the turbulence to increase or decrease
with increasing wind speed? Would this suggest an increase or decrease
in the atmospheric resistance and so, in the sensible heat flux with
increasing wind
speed? How about latent heat flux? However, wouldn't an increase in
wind speed also change the vertical temperature profile and decrease
the vertical
temperature differences between any pair of levels
(ΔT),
thereby tending to lower the sensible heat flux? If ΔT decreases would
this occur with a decrease in
both the surface temperature and an increase in the temperature at some
level above the surface or would just one or the other levels change
temperature.
</p>
<p>Answers to these questions may not be obvious or even determinable
without performing simulations. The basic question we will pose in the
scenario is:
would you expect the surface temperatures to increase or decrease in
response to change in wind speed?
</p>
<p>Now you see the problem. You can possibly perceive the answers to
these questions, but mathematically (using the resistance formula given
by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a>)
you are unable to prove your conclusions without further analysis. Now
consider the further dilemma: the energy for the sensible heat and for
evaporation
must come ultimately from the net radiation. If we somehow increase the
sensible heat flux by manipulation of the wind speed (or some other
parameter),
wouldn't we also likely change the latent heat flux in the same sense?
If so, where does that extra energy come from, or are both fluxes
somehow constrained
by a mutual competition for the same available radiant energy (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.1</a>)? (Later chapters will ask how the availability of substrate water influences these
parameters.)
</p>
<a name="procedure"></a> <h2>Procedure</h2>


<p>
Let's make some simulations and observe the behavior of the surface
energy fluxes, the surface temperature and the Bowen ratio. (Before
going on you
might wish to consult Oke's book on Boundary Layer Climates, Second
Edition, pp 32-42 and Monteith's book Principles of Environmental
Physics, Second
Edition.) In the simulations that follow, you will be examining the
role of the wind speed in modifying the surface fluxes of heat and
water vapor as well as the
surface and near-surface air temperatures.
</p>
<p>As you make the following simulations, you will notice that the
surface sensible heat flux and the surface temperature are related.
This is not surprising in
view of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a> and its allied resistance
laws. We find, however, that the surface sensible heat flux maximizes
within an hour or so of midday, but the surface
temperature maximizes in the mid-afternoon, as is consistent with our
own observations and the diurnal temperature lag described in Chapter
1. What about the
vertical temperature gradient when the wind speed increases or
decreases? Would the effect of changing the wind speed change the
resistance and the vertical
temperature (or moisture) gradients so as to partially counteract the
other's effect on the fluxes? After all, <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a>
tells us that the sensible heat flux depends not
on the temperature but on the vertical temperature gradient (as
expressed by the difference between the surface temperature and that at
the top of the surface
layer). This is an aspect we will explore further in Scenario 5.
</p>

<a name="surface"></a>
<h2>Surface Wind speed, Temperature, Specific Humidity and other Constituents in the Atmsopheric Surface Layer</h2>

<p>First, what do we mean by a 'surface layer'? Specialists in the atmospheric
boundary layer may define the surface layer as the depth above the surface
over which the vertical variations in the fluxes of heat, moisture and
momentum do not vary by more than about 10%. Somewhat erroneously, this
layer is called the layer of 'constant flux' . This term is not meant
to imply that the fluxes do not change with height, but that they change
in a small way-small being defined as less than 10% of the value at the
surface. The need to define a surface layer is not as arbitrary and whimsical
as it may seem. Whether we are talking about the atmospheric surface layer
the airflow over my desk or the flow of blood within the walls of an artery,
the variation of fluid speed versus distance in the surface layer has
a characteristic logarithmic variation, such that the greatest variation
with distance occurring at the surface interface. Viewed graphically,
this type of wind profile would show a decay of speed toward the surface.
Such a logarithmic relationship results in a straight line when the speed
is plotted versus the log of the distance from the surface. Figure 2.1
shows a series of data points for two such wind speed plots, one over
a rough surface and one over a smooth surface. </p>
<p> Typically, the depth of the surface layer is about 50 m during the day and
perhaps somewhat less at night. Accordingly, in our model we will take
the surface layer to be 50 m in depth. Temperature, specific humidity,
momentum, carbon dioxide and ozone conform to logarithmic profile over
which the fluxes themselves remain constant. Because a logarithmic quantity
can not have zero value, the wind speed variation shown in Figure 2.1
has a non-zero value of height at zero wind speed. The height at which
the wind speed vanishes is called the roughness height, which is assigned
the symbol z<sub>o</sub>. The smaller the slope of the straight line the
larger the roughness length and the greater the associated turbulence.
Indeed, the slope of the straight line is inversely proportional to a
parameter known as the friction velocity, which is a direct measure of
the turbulence. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch02_files/2.gif" alt="figure 2.1"></p>

<p>
Roughness heights need to be assigned in the model. A
general rule of thumb, which holds well for uniform vegetated
surfaces is that the roughness height is about one-tenth the
average height of the roughness elements. This rule is more
problematic for irregularly distributed roughness elements such
as in a city. If buildings are typically about three stories high
(10 m), a reasonable roughness height might be taken as 1 m.
The concept is not very clear when talking about isolated roughness
elements such as trees in a field. A single tree (or two trees)
10 m high sitting isolated in a field generally will not influence
the roughness height for air flowing over that field. In that
case a suitable roughness height might be that appropriate to the
shorter vegetation in the field, say 0.1 m. As one adds trees to
this picture, the roughness height will gradually become
dominated by the trees, so that a forest of trees 10 m high might
have a roughness of 1 m. Beyond a certain density, when
turbulent eddies in the atmosphere can no longer penetrate to the
surface between the trees, the roughness may decrease as the
tree canopy becomes denser. In this case the wind profile over
a dense canopy of trees may respond as if the actual surface were
near tree top level and the roughness height would be
appropriate to a smooth layer formed by an ensemble of tree
crowns. Thus, care must be made in assigning a roughness
height in a particular problem.
</p>
<p>
Other variables than wind speed, such as temperature
(which is associated with sensible heat flux), specific
humidity (which is associated with latent heat flux), carbon
dioxide and ozone also obey logarithmic profile laws, such
that the change in these variables with height increases
in an exponential manner as one approaches the surface. A
rule is that when a surface interface acts as a source for
the flux the associated variable is a maximum at the surface.
When the surface acts as a sink for the flux the associated
variable is a minimum at the surface. Thus, in the case of
temperature, the surface constitutes a source of sensible
heat flux during the day and exhibits a temperature maximum;
a temperature minimum occurs at night under conditions of
downward sensible heat flux. Momentum flux always has a sink
at the surface where the wind speed (at the roughness height)
is always zero.
</p>
<p>
The mathematical surface - that level which the logarithmic
functions perceive as the surface -- need not be identical
to the physical surface which you and I perceive as the ground.
The height of the mathematical surface may lie some distance
above the ground surface. This level is referred to as the
<em>displacement plane</em>. In the case of a dense tree canopy, the
wind speed may behave as if the tops of the trees constituted
a smooth surface. The actual ground surface beneath the trees
might be meters below the mathematically defined displacement
height. In our model, all heights are taken with respect to
the displacement plane. Although the user must decide what is
the actual height of the displacement plane above the
physical surface, we need not specify the displacement
height. All heights in the model are defined with respect
to the displacement height. Typically, the displacement height
is about two-thirds of the average height of the obstacles
except when the obstacles are irregularly spaced, fairly close
together or quite far apart. For example, in the case of
the dense tree canopy, the displacement plane might be close
to tree top level rather than at two-thirds the height of
the trees.

<a name="Level1"></a>
<strong>Level 1</strong>

<a name="L1S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Change wind speeds at all levels</strong>

<p>Let us first consider the role of the wind speed itself. After
running the default case, make another run after decreasing the wind
speeds by, say, half
<strong>at all levels</strong> in the wind speed profile. Watch and
explain what happens to the fluxes and the air temperatures in
comparison to the default case. Check
the behavior of the ground fluxes and the maximum temperature. Is this
behavior consistent with the flux and resistance laws of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2 and 2.3</a>?
Why does the
net radiation decrease slightly as a result of slowing down the wind
speed? (For the answer to this, look at the radiant surface temperature
and ask yourself what
effect that parameter has in the net radiant flux at the surface.)
</p>
<p>Look closely at the sensible heat flux, and you should see small
fluctuations in this parameter and in the wind speed at 50 m during the
evening, which die
down when the wind speeds are reduced. Note that the evaporation
vanishes at night no matter what the wind speed.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Geostrophic wind and the balance of forces</strong>

<p>The geostrophic wind speed is simply a measure of the pressure gradient and
therefore the pressure gradient force. Since we specify the surface geostrophic
wind we are effectively specifying the surface pressure gradient. Normally on
the large scale and away from the surface, where friction is very important, the
pressure gradient force is closely balanced by the Coriolis force, which is
proportional to the wind speed. So when the wind speed is large, the pressure gradient
force (geostrophic wind speed) must be large in order to balance it. If balance
does not occur, however, there is a net force and a net force requires an
acceleration or deceleration of the wind speed.
</p>
<p>
In the model, we assume that, initially, the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces
are balanced (geostrophic balance) at all levels above 550 m from the surface.
This assumption is not made at the surface. Instead, we specify the surface pressure
gradient force to be constant from 550 m above the surface to the surface. Whereas
the two forces are assumed to be initially in balance at 550 m and above, they are
not necessarily equal below this level. Why do we not let the two be equal all the
way to the ground? The reason is friction, which causes the winds to decrease
with decreasing altitude below about 0.5 – 1.0 km above the ground. (In fact,
friction indirectly extends its effect through mixing to greater heights.) Since
the wind speed decreases fairly rapidly with height near the surface, the pressure
gradient force will likely exceed the Coriolis force below 550 m. If a force balance
were to be maintained that additional force would be the frictional force.
</p>
<p>
Agreed that this is a bit of an artifice. We make this assumption only to start the
model in a reasonable manner. What actually happens once the model begins to execute
is that an effective force imbalance is transmitted up through the mixing layer via
the effects of turbulent mixing associated with the sensible heat flux. This turbulent
mixing, manifested by sensible heat fluxes, can vary in time. The imbalance between
Coriolis and pressure gradient forces, which were initially equal above 550m, is created
by a kind of virtual friction produced by the turbulent mixing in which faster and slower
moving air mix. This mixing is manifested by faster moving air moving to levels with
slower moving winds and visa versa. This mixing creates a virtual friction force, which
may tend to balance, which is to say that the three forces, Coriolis, pressure gradient
and friction may be closely in balance. But close is not exact, and the effect of mixing
is inevitably to create a resultant acceleration or deceleration. These accelerations
are can be large at times, causing the wind to vary rapidly with time. If the imbalance
between the forces is excessive, large oscillations in the wind field can develop as
the result of the component accelerations of the wind. In reality, such oscillations may
be associated with the development of the nocturnal, low-level (1000-1500 m) jet. However,
if you impose something unreasonable on the wind field, the simulation may
decide to self destruct. It is the model's way of saying 'Ouch p-p-please give me something reasonable!')
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Night time winds</strong>
<p>Re-run the default simulation, reducing the wind speeds again by a
factor of two. Look at the night time winds and temperatures. (If
nothing dramatic happens,
decrease the wind speeds again uniformly by a factor of two. Observe
the fluxes again but pay particular attention to the winds and surface
temperatures at night.
Do you conclude that a calm night causes more cooling? How does the
change in surface air and surface radiant temperatures compare between
the default and
light wind cases during the day and at night.
</p>
<p>You might see the surface air temperature at 1.5 m decrease when the
wind speed is decreased. Intuitively, one would expect a surface to
cool when the
wind speed is increased and visa versa. Blow on your hand and you will
see that this is true. So why might the 1.5 m temperature be higher in
the higher wind
speed case? Does this apply also to the surface radiant temperature?
Hint: what has happened to the vertical temperature difference from 1.5
m to the surface
when the wind speed is increased or decreased?
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<a name="Level2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the temperature in the State College, PA 'Barrens', a
wilderness region with scrubby vegetation and poor heat conducting
soils, cools to sub
freeing temperatures at the surface in August. See if you can simulate,
using the State College sounding, a freezing night during summertime by
reducing the wind
speeds in the initial conditions.
</p>
<p>What might you expect under mixed conditions; that of a cloudy night
with strong winds or a clear night with calm winds? You can make this
simulation by
imposing a 'cloud fraction' of say 0.5. If you were a fruit grower,
what types of weather conditions could conceivably threaten your crop
by night time freezing
temperatures?
</p>

<p>At nightfall, the virtual frictional force discussed above vanishes
with the disappearance of mixing provided by sensible heat flux. What
effect might this
sudden change in the force balance have on the winds. Do you see any
hint that a profound acceleration is occurring in the wind speeds above
the lowest 0.5 km?
(Hint: look at the evolution of the vertical profiles of the wind in
the animation.)
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Simulation 2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Make a pair of runs for roughness heights of, say, 0.5 m and 0.1
m and note the differences in the wind speed at 10 m for both situations
at the same time of day.
<p>Suppose that we wanted to know what is the wind speed at face
level (1.5 m) for these two simulations, but all we had was the
wind speed at 10 m. Plot the 10 m wind speed on a piece of semi
log paper in which the x-axis is labeled wind speed and the y-axis
(the log axis) is labeled height. Label the height axis at 0.1,
1 and 10 m. Knowing that the wind speed s zero at the roughness
height, connect the two points by a straight line from 10 m for
each simulation and determine the wind speed at face level for
these two roughness cases.

A well-known radical, anti-war organization during the 1960's was known as the "Weathermen," so called

Obviously, the initialized wind speeds themselves govern the wind speeds, although the latter can evolve

on surface radiant and air temperatures and the surface energy fluxes.

First, ask yourself the following questions: Would you expect the
sensible heat flux (and, for that matter, the latent heat flux) to
increase or decrease with
increasing wind speed? How about the surface temperature? To answer
this question, first consider the concept of atmospheric resistance.
Away from hard
surfaces (where molecular processes dominate the flux of heat across
the air interface directly in contact with that surface), the
atmospheric resistance is related to
the efficiency of turbulent eddies to carry away the heat and water
vapor; refer to <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2 and 2.3</a>.
Would you expect the turbulence to increase or decrease
with increasing wind speed? Would this suggest an increase or decrease
in the atmospheric resistance and so, in the sensible heat flux with
increasing wind
speed? How about latent heat flux? However, wouldn't an increase in
wind speed also change the vertical temperature profile and decrease
the vertical
temperature differences between any pair of levels
(ΔT),
thereby tending to lower the sensible heat flux? If ΔT decreases would
this occur with a decrease in
both the surface temperature and an increase in the temperature at some
level above the surface or would just one or the other levels change
temperature.
</p>
<p>Answers to these questions may not be obvious or even determinable
without performing simulations. The basic question we will pose in the
scenario is:
would you expect the surface temperatures to increase or decrease in
response to change in wind speed?
</p>
<p>Now you see the problem. You can possibly perceive the answers to
these questions, but mathematically (using the resistance formula given
by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a>)
you are unable to prove your conclusions without further analysis. Now
consider the further dilemma: the energy for the sensible heat and for
evaporation
must come ultimately from the net radiation. If we somehow increase the
sensible heat flux by manipulation of the wind speed (or some other
parameter),
wouldn't we also likely change the latent heat flux in the same sense?
If so, where does that extra energy come from, or are both fluxes
somehow constrained
by a mutual competition for the same available radiant energy (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.1</a>)? (Later chapters will ask how the availability of substrate water influences these
parameters.)
</p>
<a name="procedure"></a> <h2>Procedure</h2>


<p>
Let's make some simulations and observe the behavior of the surface
energy fluxes, the surface temperature and the Bowen ratio. (Before
going on you
might wish to consult Oke's book on Boundary Layer Climates, Second
Edition, pp 32-42 and Monteith's book Principles of Environmental
Physics, Second
Edition.) In the simulations that follow, you will be examining the
role of the wind speed in modifying the surface fluxes of heat and
water vapor as well as the
surface and near-surface air temperatures.
</p>
<p>As you make the following simulations, you will notice that the
surface sensible heat flux and the surface temperature are related.
This is not surprising in
view of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a> and its allied resistance
laws. We find, however, that the surface sensible heat flux maximizes
within an hour or so of midday, but the surface
temperature maximizes in the mid-afternoon, as is consistent with our
own observations and the diurnal temperature lag described in Chapter
1. What about the
vertical temperature gradient when the wind speed increases or
decreases? Would the effect of changing the wind speed change the
resistance and the vertical
temperature (or moisture) gradients so as to partially counteract the
other's effect on the fluxes? After all, <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2</a>
tells us that the sensible heat flux depends not
on the temperature but on the vertical temperature gradient (as
expressed by the difference between the surface temperature and that at
the top of the surface
layer). This is an aspect we will explore further in Scenario 5.
</p>

<a name="surface"></a>
<h2>Surface Wind speed, Temperature, Specific Humidity and other Constituents in the Atmsopheric Surface Layer</h2>

<p>First, what do we mean by a 'surface layer'? Specialists in the atmospheric
boundary layer may define the surface layer as the depth above the surface
over which the vertical variations in the fluxes of heat, moisture and
momentum do not vary by more than about 10%. Somewhat erroneously, this
layer is called the layer of 'constant flux' . This term is not meant
to imply that the fluxes do not change with height, but that they change
in a small way-small being defined as less than 10% of the value at the
surface. The need to define a surface layer is not as arbitrary and whimsical
as it may seem. Whether we are talking about the atmospheric surface layer
the airflow over my desk or the flow of blood within the walls of an artery,
the variation of fluid speed versus distance in the surface layer has
a characteristic logarithmic variation, such that the greatest variation
with distance occurring at the surface interface. Viewed graphically,
this type of wind profile would show a decay of speed toward the surface.
Such a logarithmic relationship results in a straight line when the speed
is plotted versus the log of the distance from the surface. Figure 2.1
shows a series of data points for two such wind speed plots, one over
a rough surface and one over a smooth surface. </p>
<p> Typically, the depth of the surface layer is about 50 m during the day and
perhaps somewhat less at night. Accordingly, in our model we will take
the surface layer to be 50 m in depth. Temperature, specific humidity,
momentum, carbon dioxide and ozone conform to logarithmic profile over
which the fluxes themselves remain constant. Because a logarithmic quantity
can not have zero value, the wind speed variation shown in Figure 2.1
has a non-zero value of height at zero wind speed. The height at which
the wind speed vanishes is called the roughness height, which is assigned
the symbol z<sub>o</sub>. The smaller the slope of the straight line the
larger the roughness length and the greater the associated turbulence.
Indeed, the slope of the straight line is inversely proportional to a
parameter known as the friction velocity, which is a direct measure of
the turbulence. </p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch02_files/2.gif" alt="figure 2.1"></p>

<p>
Roughness heights need to be assigned in the model. A
general rule of thumb, which holds well for uniform vegetated
surfaces is that the roughness height is about one-tenth the
average height of the roughness elements. This rule is more
problematic for irregularly distributed roughness elements such
as in a city. If buildings are typically about three stories high
(10 m), a reasonable roughness height might be taken as 1 m.
The concept is not very clear when talking about isolated roughness
elements such as trees in a field. A single tree (or two trees)
10 m high sitting isolated in a field generally will not influence
the roughness height for air flowing over that field. In that
case a suitable roughness height might be that appropriate to the
shorter vegetation in the field, say 0.1 m. As one adds trees to
this picture, the roughness height will gradually become
dominated by the trees, so that a forest of trees 10 m high might
have a roughness of 1 m. Beyond a certain density, when
turbulent eddies in the atmosphere can no longer penetrate to the
surface between the trees, the roughness may decrease as the
tree canopy becomes denser. In this case the wind profile over
a dense canopy of trees may respond as if the actual surface were
near tree top level and the roughness height would be
appropriate to a smooth layer formed by an ensemble of tree
crowns. Thus, care must be made in assigning a roughness
height in a particular problem.
</p>
<p>
Other variables than wind speed, such as temperature
(which is associated with sensible heat flux), specific
humidity (which is associated with latent heat flux), carbon
dioxide and ozone also obey logarithmic profile laws, such
that the change in these variables with height increases
in an exponential manner as one approaches the surface. A
rule is that when a surface interface acts as a source for
the flux the associated variable is a maximum at the surface.
When the surface acts as a sink for the flux the associated
variable is a minimum at the surface. Thus, in the case of
temperature, the surface constitutes a source of sensible
heat flux during the day and exhibits a temperature maximum;
a temperature minimum occurs at night under conditions of
downward sensible heat flux. Momentum flux always has a sink
at the surface where the wind speed (at the roughness height)
is always zero.
</p>
<p>
The mathematical surface - that level which the logarithmic
functions perceive as the surface -- need not be identical
to the physical surface which you and I perceive as the ground.
The height of the mathematical surface may lie some distance
above the ground surface. This level is referred to as the
<em>displacement plane</em>. In the case of a dense tree canopy, the
wind speed may behave as if the tops of the trees constituted
a smooth surface. The actual ground surface beneath the trees
might be meters below the mathematically defined displacement
height. In our model, all heights are taken with respect to
the displacement plane. Although the user must decide what is
the actual height of the displacement plane above the
physical surface, we need not specify the displacement
height. All heights in the model are defined with respect
to the displacement height. Typically, the displacement height
is about two-thirds of the average height of the obstacles
except when the obstacles are irregularly spaced, fairly close
together or quite far apart. For example, in the case of
the dense tree canopy, the displacement plane might be close
to tree top level rather than at two-thirds the height of
the trees.

<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Change wind speeds at all levels</strong>

<p>Let us first consider the role of the wind speed itself. After
running the default case, make another run after decreasing the wind
speeds by, say, half
<strong>at all levels</strong> in the wind speed profile. Watch and
explain what happens to the fluxes and the air temperatures in
comparison to the default case. Check
the behavior of the ground fluxes and the maximum temperature. Is this
behavior consistent with the flux and resistance laws of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 2.2 and 2.3</a>?
Why does the
net radiation decrease slightly as a result of slowing down the wind
speed? (For the answer to this, look at the radiant surface temperature
and ask yourself what
effect that parameter has in the net radiant flux at the surface.)
</p>
<p>Look closely at the sensible heat flux, and you should see small
fluctuations in this parameter and in the wind speed at 50 m during the
evening, which die
down when the wind speeds are reduced. Note that the evaporation
vanishes at night no matter what the wind speed.
</p>
</li>

<li><strong>Geostrophic wind and the balance of forces</strong>

<p>The geostrophic wind speed is simply a measure of the pressure gradient and
therefore the pressure gradient force. Since we specify the surface geostrophic
wind we are effectively specifying the surface pressure gradient. Normally on
the large scale and away from the surface, where friction is very important, the
pressure gradient force is closely balanced by the Coriolis force, which is
proportional to the wind speed. So when the wind speed is large, the pressure gradient
force (geostrophic wind speed) must be large in order to balance it. If balance
does not occur, however, there is a net force and a net force requires an
acceleration or deceleration of the wind speed.
</p>
<p>
In the model, we assume that, initially, the Coriolis and pressure gradient forces
are balanced (geostrophic balance) at all levels above 550 m from the surface.
This assumption is not made at the surface. Instead, we specify the surface pressure
gradient force to be constant from 550 m above the surface to the surface. Whereas
the two forces are assumed to be initially in balance at 550 m and above, they are
not necessarily equal below this level. Why do we not let the two be equal all the
way to the ground? The reason is friction, which causes the winds to decrease
with decreasing altitude below about 0.5 – 1.0 km above the ground. (In fact,
friction indirectly extends its effect through mixing to greater heights.) Since
the wind speed decreases fairly rapidly with height near the surface, the pressure
gradient force will likely exceed the Coriolis force below 550 m. If a force balance
were to be maintained that additional force would be the frictional force.
</p>
<p>
Agreed that this is a bit of an artifice. We make this assumption only to start the
model in a reasonable manner. What actually happens once the model begins to execute
is that an effective force imbalance is transmitted up through the mixing layer via
the effects of turbulent mixing associated with the sensible heat flux. This turbulent
mixing, manifested by sensible heat fluxes, can vary in time. The imbalance between
Coriolis and pressure gradient forces, which were initially equal above 550m, is created
by a kind of virtual friction produced by the turbulent mixing in which faster and slower
moving air mix. This mixing is manifested by faster moving air moving to levels with
slower moving winds and visa versa. This mixing creates a virtual friction force, which
may tend to balance, which is to say that the three forces, Coriolis, pressure gradient
and friction may be closely in balance. But close is not exact, and the effect of mixing
is inevitably to create a resultant acceleration or deceleration. These accelerations
are can be large at times, causing the wind to vary rapidly with time. If the imbalance
between the forces is excessive, large oscillations in the wind field can develop as
the result of the component accelerations of the wind. In reality, such oscillations may
be associated with the development of the nocturnal, low-level (1000-1500 m) jet. However,
if you impose something unreasonable on the wind field, the simulation may
decide to self destruct. It is the model's way of saying 'Ouch p-p-please give me something reasonable!')

<p><em>Simulation 2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Night time winds</strong>
<p>Re-run the default simulation, reducing the wind speeds again by a
factor of two. Look at the night time winds and temperatures. (If
nothing dramatic happens,
decrease the wind speeds again uniformly by a factor of two. Observe
the fluxes again but pay particular attention to the winds and surface
temperatures at night.
Do you conclude that a calm night causes more cooling? How does the
change in surface air and surface radiant temperatures compare between
the default and
light wind cases during the day and at night.
</p>
<p>You might see the surface air temperature at 1.5 m decrease when the
wind speed is decreased. Intuitively, one would expect a surface to
cool when the
wind speed is increased and visa versa. Blow on your hand and you will
see that this is true. So why might the 1.5 m temperature be higher in
the higher wind
speed case? Does this apply also to the surface radiant temperature?
Hint: what has happened to the vertical temperature difference from 1.5
m to the surface
when the wind speed is increased or decreased?
</p>
</li>
</ul>


<a name="Level2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the temperature in the State College, PA 'Barrens', a
wilderness region with scrubby vegetation and poor heat conducting
soils, cools to sub
freeing temperatures at the surface in August. See if you can simulate,
using the State College sounding, a freezing night during summertime by
reducing the wind
speeds in the initial conditions.
</p>
<p>What might you expect under mixed conditions; that of a cloudy night
with strong winds or a clear night with calm winds? You can make this
simulation by
imposing a 'cloud fraction' of say 0.5. If you were a fruit grower,
what types of weather conditions could conceivably threaten your crop
by night time freezing
temperatures?
</p>

<p>At nightfall, the virtual frictional force discussed above vanishes
with the disappearance of mixing provided by sensible heat flux. What
effect might this
sudden change in the force balance have on the winds. Do you see any
hint that a profound acceleration is occurring in the wind speeds above
the lowest 0.5 km?
(Hint: look at the evolution of the vertical profiles of the wind in
the animation.)
</p>

</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Simulation 2:</em></p>

<ul>
<li>Make a pair of runs for roughness heights of, say, 0.5 m and 0.1
m and note the differences in the wind speed at 10 m for both situations
at the same time of day.
<p>Suppose that we wanted to know what is the wind speed at face
level (1.5 m) for these two simulations, but all we had was the
wind speed at 10 m. Plot the 10 m wind speed on a piece of semi
log paper in which the x-axis is labeled wind speed and the y-axis
(the log axis) is labeled height. Label the height axis at 0.1,
1 and 10 m. Knowing that the wind speed s zero at the roughness
height, connect the two points by a straight line from 10 m for
each simulation and determine the wind speed at face level for
these two roughness cases.
