<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 12</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Plants survive by taking in carbon dioxide and converting the carbon
to its own substance (<em>assimilation</em>). The net carbon gain manifests
itself as an increase in the biomass, which consists of roots, stem, leaves,
flowers, etc. Carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) enters the plants through
the stomates, and so, the rate of biomass increase is closely dependent
on the stomatal resistance. Not surprisingly therefore, the economic value
of a crop is closely tied to the level of transpiration, which also depends
on the stomatal resistance. Since transpiration is not beneficial to the
plant except to reduce the leaf temperature<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>,
we might expect plants to favor a maximization of carbon dioxide intake
in relation to transpiration. Thus, plants benefit most by keeping the
stomates open, regardless of the transpiration, as long as sufficient
water reserves are available to the roots. By now you realize from the
simulations that decreasing soil water content does not necessarily reduce
transpiration until the plant perceives itself to be in danger of water
stress, although the stress signal does not depend uniquely on soil water
content. </p>
<p>In these days of the runaway greenhouse effect scare,
some researchers take heart that an increase in carbon
dioxide concentration in the atmosphere will lead to an
enhanced carbon dioxide uptake by the plants and so, to
an increased biomass production. Experiments done in the
greenhouse and in the field suggest that an increase in
carbon dioxide concentration also causes the stomatal
resistance to increase, with the net effect being a gain
in biomass and a decrease in transpiration, thus doubly
benefiting the plant. At first glance, this dual effect
of increasing assimilation and reducing water use would
seem to be beneficial. We can use our simulation model
to explore this finding.
</p>
<p>Our main purpose here, however, is simply to examine
the flux of carbon dioxide in a canopy (specifically the
carbon dioxide assimilation rate <strong><em>A</em></strong>). We can also test
the idea that an increase in stomatal resistance
associated with an increase in ambient carbon dioxide
concentration leads to both an increase in the carbon
dioxide assimilation rate and possibly to a decrease
in transpiration.
</p>

<a name="one"></a>
<p>
<sup>1</sup> Water transport from root to leaf is
nevertheless critical in bringing nutrients and hormones
to the plant factory. Transpiration is also necessary
to maintain a reasonable leaf temperature. Although
photochemical processes tend to be more efficient at
higher temperatures, very high temperatures, however,
will not only force the plant to lose more water
through the leaves but will tend to destroy cellular
function.
</p>
<a name="outside"></a> <h2>Calculating the carbon dioxide assimilation rate from the outside in</h2>


<p>
Let us return to the idea that a flux of a substance moves
down a gradient of potential and across a resistance, the Ohm's
law analog for diffusive fluxes. The source of carbon dioxide
is in the atmosphere, let us say above the plant canopy, where
the concentration of carbon dioxide gas (<em><strong>C<sub>a</sub></strong></em>) has a mean value
of about 350 parts per million (of CO<sub>2</sub>) by volume of air (ppmv),
which is numerically equivalent to 350 microbars or to 350 mol
(CO<sub>2</sub>) mol<sup>-1</sup> (air) times 10<sup>-6</sup> . We will refer to this ambient
carbon dioxide concentration above the canopy as (<em><strong>C</strong></em><sub>a</sub>). If the
drop in carbon dioxide potential is <strong><em>C</em></strong> and the resistance
across that potential drop is r, the flux of carbon dioxide
(FCO<sub>2</sub>) is given by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.1</a>.
</p>
<p>
If the plant is to ingest carbon molecules there must be a diffusive flux of
CO<sub>2</sub> downward through the surface layer along decreasing concentration
to the leaf surface (see <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch08.html">Figure 8.1</a>). The appropriate
resistances are: 1) The turbulent resistance in the surface layer, which
we will call r<sub>CO2</sub>, 2) Once inside the canopy the molecules
move through the interleaf airspaces and across the surface boundary layer
of the leaf, where the resistance is r<sub>ahc</sub>, and 3) Ignoring
the flux of carbon dioxide across the cuticular part of the leaf surface,
the carbon dioxide molecules then penetrate into the leaf via the stomates
where they encounter an internal (or intercellular) carbon dioxide concentration
<strong><em>C</em><sub>i</sub></strong>, and the stomatal resistance to carbon dioxide
flux of r<sub>sc</sub> Ci is representative of the concentration of carbon
dioxide in the mesophyll waiting to be photosynthesized - a sort of waiting
room for carbon atoms in line to be processed. Accordingly, we can write
a somewhat more elaborate version of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.1</a>
in the form of <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.2</a> (note that the density
of carbon dioxide gas (kg m<sup>-3</sup> of CO<sub>2</sub>) is necessary
to make the units agree with the left hand side of the equation which
has the units of kg (CO<sub>2</sub>) m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)).
This formulation results in what is known as the CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation
rate, <strong><em>A</em></strong>.</p>
<p>Resistances for carbon dioxide flux are generally somewhat larger than
those of water vapor because the molecular diffusivity of carbon dioxide
in air is less than that of water vapor in air (possibly because the former
is somewhat heavier (molecular weight 44) than water vapor (molecular
weight 18)). However, the differences in resistances between carbon
dioxide and water vapor in air are generally less than a factor of two
(depending on what resistance one is talking about). Accordingly,
let us agree for the sake of argument (since it alters no fundamental
result) that the two sets of resistances, that for water vapor and
that for carbon dioxide, are equal.
</p>
<p>
Imagine a flux of water vapor from the stomates into the surrounding
interleaf airspaces, as in <a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch07.html#equations">Eqn. 7.3</a>, and thence into the surface layer
above the canopy through resistance r<sub>v</sub> . Ignoring the parallel water
vapor flux from the ground below the canopy, the flux of water vapor
between the leaf and the atmospheric surface layer (in kg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>)
is given by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.3</a>. Note that e<sub>a</sub> here refers to the vapor pressure
above the canopy, <em>i.e.</em> at some elevation where the carbon dioxide
concentration is not immediately affected by transient perturbations
in the canopy fluxes.
</p>
<p>
Now, if we equate the water vapor and carbon dioxide resistances,
and take a ratio of the two fluxes (dividing <a href="#equations">
Eqn. 12.2</a> by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.3</a>
to yield <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.4</a>), we obtain a measure of the <em>water use efficiency
(WUE)</em>, which is the essentially the ratio of the carbon dioxide
concentration gradient between the atmosphere above the plant canopy
and that in the substomatal cavities to the gradient in vapor
pressure between the inside of the leaf and that in the surface layer
above the canopy. Note, however, that because of the 30-fold smaller
concentration of carbon dioxide than water vapor in the atmosphere,
the magnitude of the water fluxes will be much larger than those for
CO<sub>2</sub>. A typical value for the flux of carbon dioxide from air to
plant (FCO<sub>2</sub>) at noon on a sunny summer day  is 1 x10<sup>-6</sup> kg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>,
or 20 micro moles per square meter per second.
</p>
<p>
The substomatal concentration <strong><em>C<sub></sub></em></strong><sub>i</sub> is known to be
approximately constant under normal atmospheric and
plant conditions. It is about 220 ppmv for C<sub>3</sub> plants,
such as wheat, rice and potatoes, and 120 ppmv for C<sub>4</sub>
plants, such as corn and sorghum. <strong><em>C<sub></sub></em></strong><sub>i</sub> can vary slightly
with ambient conditions. We will have more to say about
this intriguing parameter later in these notes. (The
physiological differences between C<sub>3</sub>and C<sub>4</sub> plants is beyond
the scope of this course, except to mention that the latter
represents plants that have evolved to have four carbon
pathways rather than three pathways in the photosynthesis
process as in ΔC<sub>3</sub> plants.)
</p>
<p>
<a href="#equations">Eqn 12.4.</a> shows us that the primary control of water use
efficiency is exerted by the vapor pressure deficit between
that at the leaf surface and that above the canopy. Assuming
that the latter is largely controlled by the atmosphere, the
single most important variable in the WUE relationship is the
vapor pressure in the leaf, which is to say that control
rests with the leaf temperature. We might imagine that the
plant is trying to maximize the WUE, but, at the same time,
maximize its rate of carbon intake. Blum (1989) cites a
formula relating plant yield (YE) to WUE, more specifically
the product of WUE times the evapotrananspiration. He also
cites another formula relating biomass creation to the
ratio of transpiration to potential evapotranspiration,
which is a little bit like our parameter M, the moisture
availability.
</p>

<a name="inside"></a>
<h2>Calculating the carbon dioxide assimilation rate from the inside</h2>

<p>Well beyond the scope of this course is the frightening
terrain of pure plant physiology. Nevertheless, plant
physiologists are also struggling with the modeling aspects
of assimilation rates. One of the most well known of the
current assimilation models is one constructed by Farquhar
(1989); of feedforward fame. The Farquhar model, which deals
primarily with C<sub>3</sub> plants, attempts to describe curve shown
in Figure 12.1, which emerges from numerous experiments in
which <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub> is varied as a function of assimilation rate. We see
that <strong><em>A</em></strong> increases first rapidly and almost linearly with
increasing <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub> and then much more slowly beyond a bend in the
curve which is actually not far from the characteristic present-day
values of <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub> for the plant. Assumed in this 
figure is that <strong><em>Ca</em></strong> is
also increased proportionally with <strong><em>C</em></strong><em><sub>i</sub></em>. Typically, C<sub>3</sub> plants tend
to have a more gradual transition from rapidly increasing assimilation
rate to slowly increasing assimilation rate than C<sub>4</sub> plants, as
shown in Figure 12.1. The bend in the two curves occurs close
to the present-day normal values for internal carbon dioxide
concentrations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch12_files/12_002.gif" alt="figure 12.1"></p>

<p>
The bend also represents a transition between two
physiological states of the plant, one in which the
photosynthesis is limited by the availability of an organic
compound called <em>Rubisco</em>, which is involved in the reduction
and oxidation in the C<sub>3</sub>  pathway (low <strong><em>C</em></strong><em><sub>i</sub></em>), and the other
in which photosynthesis is limited by the availability of
photon flux (high <strong><em>C</em></strong><em><sub>i</sub></em>). Clearly, an increase in internal
carbon dioxide concentration causes the assimilation rate
to increase, although at a rapidly decreasing rate with
increasing concentration. We will later touch on the
importance of this decrease in assimilation rate with
increasing carbon dioxide concentration.
</p>
<p>Laboratory measurements show that an increase in carbon
dioxide concentration at the surface of the leaf induces
an increase in stomatal resistance. A glance at Figure 12.1
agrees with this in that the assimilation rate does not
increase rapidly with an increase in internal carbon dioxide
concentration beyond present-day concentrations. Experiments
further show that while fluctuations in stomatal resistance
and other local factors do not significantly affect internal
carbon dioxide concentration, an increase in ambient carbon
dioxide concentration moves the entire curves for both C<sub>3</sub> and
C<sub>4</sub> plants, shown in Figure 12.1,
toward the right. Despite
this shift, the net effect of increasing C<sub>i</sub> is one of an
increase in assimilation rate even for C<sub>4</sub> plants (although
the sharper transition at the bend in the curves followed
by a nearly constant value of assimilation rate of the C<sub>4</sub>
curve above the bend translates to a smaller gain in <strong><em>A</em></strong> for
C<sub>4</sub> plants than for C<sub>3</sub> plants with an increase in 
<strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>a</sub> or <strong><em>C</em><sub>i</sub></strong>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch12_files/12.gif" alt="figure 12.2"></p>

<a name="changes"></a> 
<h2>Changes in assimilation rate and transpiration with increasing ambient carbon dioxide concentration</h2>


<p>Worst-case scenarios (not one of ours) suggests a near
doubling of ambient carbon dioxide concentration by the
middle of the next century, from the present 350 ppmv to
about 660 ppmv, as the result of continue fossil fuel
burning. This increase already comes on top of an increase
from 280 ppmv from the middle of the last century to
about 330 ppmv a couple decades ago. A first guess based
on <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.2</a> is that the doubling in <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>a</sub> would cause the
assimilation rate <strong><em>A</em></strong> to increase by a factor of about 4
for C<sub>3</sub> plants and about 2.5 for C<sub>4</sub> plants (assuming no
change in the values for <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub>). In fact, Cure and Acock
(1986) examined all the published measurements they could
find that were related to the response of plants to an
increase of carbon dioxide. Their results show that
the increase in assimilation rate is likely to be only
about 40% for C<sub>3</sub> plants and about 25% for C<sub>4</sub> plants.
Moreover, they show that plants grown under ambient
concentrations of 660 ppmv, or allowed to come into
equilibrium with their new enriched CO<sub>2</sub> environment,
show an even lower increase in assimilation rate, about
30% for C<sub>3</sub> plants and less than 10% for C<sub>4</sub> plants. These
increases in assimilation rates translate into increases
in biomass production.
</p>
<a name="here"></a>
<p>
A further implication of Cure and Acock's (1986) data is that transpiration
should decrease by about 20% as the result of carbon dioxide doubling!
What <a href="#equations">Eqn. 12.1</a> shows clearly is that an increase
of 20% in stomatal resistance is not sufficiently large to hold the assimilation
rate to only a 40% increase; rather, both <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub>
and stomatal resistance must increase as ambient carbon dioxide concentration
is increased for this to hold true. This increase in stomatal resistance
seems to be associated with the leaf's ability to sense an increase in
carbon dioxide concentration at its surface<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a>.
More recent studies have shown that an increase of carbon dioxide concentration
by a factor of two may produce only a 5% decrease in transpiration and
only a modest increase in biomass! This is tantamount to saying that a
huge increase in ambient carbon concentration has little effect on the
plants. How discouraging to learn that this beneficial side effect of
fossil fuel burning will not have such a profound beneficial effect after
all.
</p>
<p>Alternately stated, if one doubles the amount of food on the
table (ambient carbon dioxide concentration), people will stuff
their mouths more (internal carbon dioxide concentration), but
they will not ingest twice as much food. Moreover, given some
time to equilibrate, people may get sufficiently fed up
(literally) that they will become more resistant to temptation
and not ingest much more food than before, although it is
certainly true that the more food available the more one eats
(up to a point). Thus, stomatal resistance increases in response
to the plant's inability to assimilate all that is put on
its plate, given the amount of available sunshine and nutrients
for carrying out all its chemical reactions. Ultimately, the
availability of sunlight will restrict the increase in biomass.
(Speaking of resistance, anyone who has ever tried to feed
an infant would know what happens when you try to increase the
food intake rate by increasing the mass of goop on the end
of a spoon! You do get more inside the infant, but a lot of
resistance is put forth and a lot of goop ends up on the walls).
</p>
<p>
<sup>2</sup> Recent measurements by Kell Wilson at the USDA field site
in Beltsville, MD, of soybeans and corn indicate that the
increase in stomatal resistance due to a doubling of carbon
dioxide concentration is larger than reported by Cure and
Acock, perhaps as much as 40 or 50%.
</p>

<a name="simulations"></a> 
<h2>Simulations</h2>

<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>The model you have come to know and love calculates carbon
dioxide flux and disgorges it in units of kg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>. Let us
review a couple principles of scaling from a leaf to a canopy.
As with water vapor fluxes, the calculations refer to flux
per unit sunlit leaf area, but the output is in terms of flux
per unit horizontal surface area. As in previous simulations
we calculate fluxes for each leaf or leaf strata and divide
the leaf resistances by the leaf area index multiplied by a
<em>shelter factor</em>. The reason why we divide by the leaf area index
is that we must sum up all the individual leaf fluxes for
one-sided transpiration. As pointed out previously, were we
to simply divide by LAI, (nearly equivalent to multiplying
the transpiration fluxes by LAI) the resultant fluxes would
generally be too large because the transpiring area would be
overestimated, since many leaves are shaded by other leaves
and thus have a larger stomatal resistance. Accordingly, we
use an equation that reduces the leaf resistances by an amount
that varies between about 1.0 for a fairly low leaf area
index to about 2.0 for very large leaf area indices. Both
the carbon dioxide and water vapor fluxes have been scaled
in this way. You may have noticed that the minimum stomatal
resistance assigned to our corn canopy is 50 sm<sup>-1</sup>, yet much
of the output of r<sub>s</sub> looked at so far shows the stomatal
resistance at values below 50. This is due to the shelter
factor calculation.
</p>

<a name="L1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>

<p><strong>Induce water stress on the corn canopy</strong></p>

<p>
Using a large leaf area index (LAI = 7), re-run the
standard corn simulation, but this time examine the carbon
dioxide fluxes and the water vapor fluxes together, as well
as the WUE (which the model calculates for you). Then, run
a simulation in which water stress manifests itself as a
plateau in the evapotranspiration and note the changes in
WUE, carbon dioxide fluxes and transpiration during the day
from the unstressed run. Look back at the previous chapter
for ways to simulate the transpiration plateau.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What is the most noticeable change in the fluxes from the unstressed to the stressed simulations? </li>
<li>What does this tell you about the behavior of the stomatal resistance
and it's impacts on <a href="#equations">Eqn 12.4</a> (although it is
not explicitly included)? </li>
<li>Under these conditions, how well did the plant perform in maximizing its goal (increased biomass) with the onset of stress? </li>
<li>What are the differences in the character of the stress response of assimilation rate to transpiration?</li>
</ol>

<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>
<p><strong>Increase the xylem resistance</strong></p>

<p>Xylem resistance does not seem to change with time very
rapidly in response to stress, though it does exhibit a decrease
and then an increase as the plant matures and then ages. Run
a simulation after doubling the xylem resistance and examine the
carbon dioxide fluxes, WUE and transpiration once again. Changes
in the xylem resistance, called Zp in the model, occur during
the life of a plant, and we have seen some of its effects in
previous chapters. It probably decreases in the early stages
of plant life and then increases again with time as the plant
matures and then senesces.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>Given that we are stressing the plant once again, how do its
responses with regard to WUE and carbon fluxes compare with those under
the water stress imparted in simulation 1? </li>
<li>Are they more or less drastic? Once again, try and figure out why the WUE
changes the way it does, i.e. which variables in <a href="#equations">Eqn.
12.4</a> are different and why? </li>
<li>How could one tell from examination of the assimilation and
transpiration curves whether stress was coming from a lack of water or
something that is causing the xylem resistance to increase?</li>
</ol>


<a name="L2"></a>
<p><strong>Level 2 Simulations</strong></p>

<a name="L2S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>
<p><strong> Pollute the ambient atmosphere; a vision of the future?</strong></p>

<p>Check out the carbon dioxide doubling issue referred to by
Cure and Acock (1986). First, double the ambient carbon
dioxide concentration to 660 ppmv, as many prognosticators
claim it will be the end of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Note the increase
in the fluxes of carbon dioxide and the WUE from the base
case and see if it is similar to the 30% increase indicated
by the results of Cure and Acock. It isn't!  How much more
or less than 30% are the changes that you see?</p>

<p>So then, increase the minimum stomatal resistance by 40%
based on Wilson's field measurements for doubled carbon
dioxide, and see if you reduce the carbon dioxide fluxes
to the 30% level predicted. This is done in the custom
plants menu. You can't, unless you also increase the substomatal
concentration, <strong><em>C</em></strong><sub>i</sub>, which you should try next. Once you have
arrived at a new assimulation rate, increase the leaf area
by the same fractional increase in <strong><em>A</em></strong> in order to simulate
the increase in biomass resulting from this increase in carbon
intake. Then, redo your simulations until you have iterated
on a solution satisfying Wilson's stomatal resistance
increases of 40% under carbon dioxide doubling. When you
finish with these simulations you will discover a surprising
fact: that the transpiration decrease is not all its cracked
up to be!</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>At what values of r<sub>smin</sub> and C<sub>I</sub> did you finally come up with the 30% increase in CO<sub>2</sub> flux?  </li>
<li>Are these values reasonable, physically speaking? </li>
<li>(At this point, look at the decrease in transpiration from
the base case.) Does that value agree with the 20% decrease
anticipated by the results of Cure and Acock? If not, is the model
full of baloney, or are Cure and Acock out to lunch? </li>
<li>Field experiments and simulations with the SimSphere model,
as opposed to laboratory measurements which make up most of Cure
and Acock's data, suggest decreases in transpiration of only few
percent, rather than the 20% found by Cure and Acock, in response
to a doubling of carbon dioxide. Suggest some additional feedback
mechanisms that might exist when an entire canopy and an atmospheric
boundary layer are taken into consideration.</li>
</ol>

<p>Look at the equations presented in this chapter for more
insight, as they are responsible for all the output and
process we are considering here.</p>

<p>Regardless of the actual amount of decrease in transpiration,
how do you think plants as a whole would change if the CO<sub>2</sub> concentration
does double in the next 100 years, based on these simulations?
Doesn't this seem like the best of both worlds for vegetation:
increasing their WUE and biomass while at the same time retaining
more water?  Are there any downsides you can think of?</p>
