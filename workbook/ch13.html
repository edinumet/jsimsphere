<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 13</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Like carbon dioxide, other gases are ingested into plants, 
some of which are harmful. One of these harmful gases is ozone, 
which is produced by photon flux interaction with pollutants, 
mainly auto emissions. Although the mechanism by which ozone
destroys plant tissue is still being studied, its presence has
undeniable effects in damaging plant leaves. As such, ozone 
looms as an important economic factor in biomass production, and
studies are underway to determine the effect of ozone on both 
corn and soybeans. The molecular weight of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is 48 
grams per mole. Not only is the molecular weight of ozone similar
to that of carbon dioxide (44 g), but the molecular diffusivity
in air and its density is also very similar. Thus, in principle,
it is a simple matter to calculate ozone flux to the mesophyll
using an analogous equation to 12.2, but with the ambient 
concentration of ozone replacing that of carbon dioxide, and the
internal contact concentration of ozone as zero. Typical 
ambient ozone concentrations vary between about 0.04 ppmv for a
relatively unpolluted atmosphere to about 0.12 ppmv for a 
polluted atmosphere (Los Angeles!). Thus, ozone concentrations 
are more than a thousand times smaller than that of carbon dioxide. </p>

<p>Unlike the carbon dioxide fluxes, however, ozone has a sink
at the ground surface as well as in the leaves. Since the
cuticular resistance is typically many times that of the 
stomatal resistance, most of the ozone ingested by the leaf is
through the stomates. However, an approximately equal flux 
is deposited at the ground surface in and around a plant canopy. 
Typical fluxes to the leaves are between 0.3 and 0.8 micrograms 
per square meter per second for a LAI of 3. Maximum fluxes tend
to occur during the afternoon in association with the reduced
stomatal and air resistances. Recent studies show that the
effect of ozone on the leaves is to increase the plant stem/root 
hydraulic resistance, which results in an increase in stomatal
resistance as well. Accordingly, not only does the ozone 
destroy leaf tissue, but also the plant restricts the intake 
of carbon dioxide, which is used to make plant material. 
Perhaps the plant is trying to protect itself by also 
restricting the intake of ozone. This might compensate somewhat
for the increased intake of ozone and its attendant 
destruction of leaf material. Obviously, in view of the damage
inflicted by ozone on crops, this buffering strategy by the
plant is only partially successful.</p>

<p>
Although ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is essential for filtering out harmful
ultraviolet rays at 20 km above the earth's surface, where 
the gas is produced by the action of photons on oxygen 
molecules, it is a harmful gas if absorbed by living things. 
Ozone is also produced near the surface by the action of 
photons on the by-products of burnt fossil fuels. While this 
problem is most acute in places like California, ozone levels
in State College do occasionally reach or exceed the maximum
recommended level of safety recently specified by the EPA 
-- 80 parts per billion by volume (0.08 ppmv). Daily variations 
in ozone concentration depend on the solar insolation, 
turbulent mixing of the atmosphere, and the level of traffic.
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html">Figure 10.1</a> shows a typical example of the daytime variation 
in ozone concentration at the top of Walker Bldg during a 
week in early summer in 1995.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch13_files/13.gif" alt="figure 13.1"></p>

<p>
A large range of sensitivity to ozone exists in 
commercial plants and trees. Black Cherry is known to be 
sensitive to ozone, white ash is somewhat sensitive and red
maple is tolerant. Studies on commercially grown plants in
California, such as cotton and grapes, show that conform
that ozone has a deleterious effect on plant growth and 
biomass production. Evidence suggests that the adverse 
effects of ozone are brought about by a reduction in root 
mass in relation to leaf area, accompanied by a reduction 
of stomatal conductance and intake of carbon. Yields of
cotton in the San Joaquin Valley of California are reduced 
about 20% by exposure to ozone produced near the surface.
Indeed, much larger declines in plant productivity have been
observed during exposure to ozone by wheat and pea plants
and in oak trees. 
</p>

<a name="here"></a>

<p>Exposure to ozone is known to increase stomatal resistance
(decrease stomatal conductance), with response times for 
the stomates on the order of a few hours or less. This response
is especially rapid in older leaves, although younger ones 
may actually increase their stomatal conductance for a short
time in response to the failure of the older leaves to 
photosynthesize. It follows that a greater ingestion of ozone
will occur, all other things being equal, in dryer soils in
which the plants may exhibit a higher stomatal resistance
than in the wet soils. <a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>

<p>Intake of ozone into plants is accomplished primarily 
through the stomata and an overall increase in stomatal 
resistance occurs over the whole plant when exposed to ozone. 
This increase in stomatal resistance in response to the ozone
intake is not sufficient to eliminate the destruction of
leaf material which remain exposed to ingested ozone. Moreover,
the effect of ozone on the more sensitive leaves remains for
many hours or days after the exposure has been removed. Reduced 
intake of both carbon dioxide and ozone and the destruction of
leaf material constitute separate but equally detrimental
effects of ozone exposure to plants. The effect of ozone exposure
on the root growth is slower and at longer term.</p>

<p>The question has been asked: what are the mechanisms by 
which ozone affects plant well being? Evidence suggests that
the intake of ozone through the stomates is the primary 
mechanism for the limitation of carbon intake. Nevertheless, 
intake of ozone through the cuticle can result in ozone reaction
with plant material. Indeed, it appears that the destruction
of ozone (and its return to oxygen) occurs when the latter 
strikes reactive surfaces including water. Thus, ozone 
destruction can occur at the ground in and around plants, 
although a ground sink of ozone may depend on its wetness.
There is evidence to suggest that ozone is blocked from
entering the stomates when the leaves are wet, such as during
the morning when dew lies on the plants.</p>

<a name="one"></a>
<p>1.) The reverse has been found in some experiments with Black
Cherry, although this completely unexpected result has not
yet been explained. </p>


<a name="ozone"></a>
<h2>Ozone effects on hydraulic and stomatal resistance</h2>

<p>A strong positive correlation has been demonstrated between
stomatal resistance (r<sub>st</sub>) and hydraulic conductivity (Zp) of the 
root-stem complex in cotton plants. Normally, Zp (also referred 
to as the xylem resistance) varies with the age and type of the
plant, but it also varies with the general health of the plant.
For ozone, laboratory experiments show that stomatal conductance
and hydraulic conductance diminish almost linearly with ozone 
concentration for 12-hour exposures in cotton plants. These same
studies also present the puzzling result that the mid day 
(minimum) leaf water potential remains almost constant (typically
at about -14 bar) with varying ozone concentration. When plotted
one against the other, hydraulic conductance varies almost
linearly with stomatal conductance.</p>

<p>Stomatal conductance (or resistance) varies considerably 
over the course of a single day, and even from day to day
depending on the amount of insolation. Yet hydraulic
conductance is found to vary slowly with time; it may, 
for example, gradually diminish over the course of a week 
or two as the plant undergoes senescence or starts to suffer
from water stress. Clearly, stomatal resistance depends on 
external and internal factors, among them hydraulic 
conductivity. Thus, if the latter is varied, stomatal 
resistance must adjust. </p>

<p>Recalling the equations governing the fluxes of water 
and water vapor, it is possible to describe, by combining 
the transpiration equation (12.3) and the hydraulic 
conductivity equation (10.3), the <em>steady state</em> flow of water 
uptake and transpiration by a plant. In this case, it can be
shown mathematically that stomatal resistance is dependent
on the choice of the plant hydraulic resistance (Zp) (or 
its inverse, the plant hydraulic conductance (Gp)). Using 
the aforementioned equation, which we have seen is contained
within the model, the calculated stomatal resistance varies
almost linearly with changing Zp, fitting the observations 
almost exactly. Since Zp increases in direct proportion to 
ozone concentration over a wide range of concentrations, one
can deduce that stomatal resistance will increase in direct
proportion to the ozone concentration.</p>

<p>As we have seen in the previous chapter, a doubling of
r<sub>st</sub> will not necessarily halve the carbon assimilation rate,
<strong><em>A</em></strong>, unless the other resistances in the denominator of the 
resistance equation were zero (which they are not!). Regardless
of this mechanistic relationship, the close correspondence 
under many conditions between xylem hydraulic conductance and 
gas exchange performance suggests that alteration of root 
properties by ozone exposure may be expected to exert harmful
effects on shoot (leaf) and canopy gas exchange. By reducing
the leaf area, an increase in ozone implicitly affects Zp. 
In real plants, the reduction in leaf area due to ozone exposure 
is due to the fact that more leaves remain on the plant than can
be supported by the roots. These leaves suffer both the chemical
poisoning by ozone but also a desiccation due to their 
inability to sustain transpiration. Thus the leaves shrivel, 
die and fall off. One could argue that the reduction in root 
conductance, which accompanies ozone exposure as well, is a 
protective mechanism to reduce ozone intake by increasing stomatal
resistance. The net result is a reduction in biomass not 
unlike that produced by water stress on the plant.</p>

<a name="changes"></a>
<h2>Changes in leaf water potential due to ozone</h2>

<p>A curious observation made by Grantz (Grantz et al., 1999) is the 
lack of response by the leaf water potential to changing stomatal
resistance induced by variations in ambient ozone concentration. 
A clue to this behavior is found in the values of leaf water 
potential, ψl, which in the cotton experiments were typically about
-14 bar. An increase in Zp will require that, to maintain 
constant transpiration, ψl must decrease still further. If the 
latter is very close to the critical water potential, however, 
a slight decrease in ψl will result in a large increase in r<sub>st</sub>.
Thus, an increase in Zp causes the stomatal resistance to 
increase by triggering a response in the leaves via the critical 
water potential mechanism discussed in previous chapters. Such a
slight decrease in ψl would not be readily measurable within
the accuracy of current techniques (~0.5-1.0 bar), which is
perhaps one reason why a few plant scientists claim that ψl is 
non sensitive to water stress or ozone concentration. If this 
hypothesis that the mechanism operates through the critical water 
potential is correct, the effects of stomatal resistance increase
due to increased ozone concentration should be much more 
apparent at mid day than in the early or mid morning. </p>

<a name="simulations"></a> <h2>Simulations</h2>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>We assume that the ozone concentration at the interior
of the leaf is zero (unlike that of the internal carbon 
dioxide concentration, Ci, in plant leaves), and that 
all the ozone has broken down into oxygen and has bonded 
in unwanted fashion with the plant material. We set in 
the model the ambient ozone concentration at a level z<sub>a</sub> 
(50 m) to C<sub>oz</sub>; at which the ozone concentrations are 
assumed to be relatively independent of the vegetation. </p>

<p>Values measured by the EPA would be at screen level 
(1.3 m). These will be somewhat lower than the ambient 
values at z<sub>a</sub>. In reality, the near-surface concentrations 
will increase during the morning and decrease during 
the afternoon, in response to increased and then 
decreased photochemical reaction with fossil fuel 
products. We further assume that the flux of ozone from
the air to the stomates is in parallel with that 
through the cuticle, and that the total leaf flux is 
in parallel with that through the cuticle and with
that into the ground, as in the big leaf model
described in chapter 7. Thus, we have three streams
of ozone: one into the stomates, one into the cuticle,
and the other into the ground. Diffusive resistances
for the ground and the leaf surfaces are given by 
the physics of resistance for a flat surface and that
for the stomates by a simple diffusive flux. We
assume further that all the ozone reaching the ground 
is absorbed (probably too extreme as assumption), that
the stomates are one-sided (although cuticles exist 
on both sides) and that a shelter factor P is necessary 
for the stomatal resistance (as explained previously). </p>


<a name="L1S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<p><strong>Observe the diurnal behavior of near-surface ozone</strong></p>


<p>Set the value of ambient ozone concentration to
0.08 ppmv, the recommended maximum concentration 
by the EPA. Run the model with the standard set of
values you have used in previous simulations for
corn. Graph the values of ozone at screen level 
(1.5 m). 
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> At what time of day is the maximum ozone concentration and why?</li>
<li> Why does the concentration of ozone not reach 0.08 ppmv?</li>
<li> Compare the simulated results with the actual
values for State College shown in Figure 1. What 
are some of the reasons for the much more irregular
pattern of changes observed in the latter as
compared with the simulations? </li>
</ol>



<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 2</em></p>

<p><strong>Vary the soil moisture, LAI, and wind speed</strong></p>


<p>Vary the root zone soil moisture availability,
the vegetation amount (LAI), and the wind speed 
as you did in the earlier chapters. Now observe 
the differences in ozone concentrations between
these simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Describe these the differences in ozone concentration and flux between the high and 
low moisture availability, high and low vegetation amounts and high and low wind 
speeds and try to explain these differences. Recall from earlier chapters how the fluxes
and resistances respond to these changes to help you explain the ozone response.  </li>
<li> Under what atmospheric conditions is the plant/canopy better off as far as minimizing 
its exposure and intake of ozone? Do you think that autohumidification might help the 
plants in this situation as well?</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>
<a name="L2S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 1</em>:</p>

<p>Below is a table obtained from measurements 
made in the field over two types of cotton plants.</p>

<p>Table 1. Stomatal conductance versus hydraulic 
conductance as measured in cotton at the University
of California, Kearney Agricultural Center, 
Riverside California (Grantz et al., 1999). 
</p>
<p>Convert the values as given to resistance with 
units of bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> for hydraulic resistance 
and units of s m<sup>-1</sup> for stomatal resistance. To 
do this first take the inverse of the values given
in the table to get the resistances. Then, divide
the hydraulic resistance in the inverse units 
given above by 4.45 and the stomatal resistance 
in the units given above by 0.025. Thus, a value
of 10 units in hydraulic conductivity becomes 
0.1 units in hydraulic resistance and 0.1/4.45 
(or about 0.02) in units of bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly 
a stomatal conductance of 0.5 units in the above 
notation becomes 2 units of resistance in the above
notation and 2/0.025 (or 80) in units of s m<sup>-1</sup>. 
</p>
<p>Now, see if you can reproduce these results
using our default sounding for mid-latitude summer.
To do this, vary the hydraulic (xylem) resistance
between 0.025 and 0.055 bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> at intervals
of 0.010 [i.e., .025 .035 .045 .055]. Assign a 
critical water potential of -30 bar (essentially 
eliminating this variable from play) and note the 
midday stomatal resistance for each. It should 
be obvious that such a low critical leaf water 
potential is never reached and therefore stomatal 
resistance does not change. Now, lower the
critical leaf water potential at you own discretion, 
and try to duplicate the results in the table above.
 Do not expect to match the values exactly, but try
and get a similar linear agreement between the 
hydraulic and stomatal resistances. (Hint: you may
begin to see agreement with the observations when
you the critical water potential is between -15
and -20 bar.) Graph the leaf water potential 
versus time for each when you get agreement with 
the table.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Can you reproduce the linear relationship 
between stomatal and hydraulic resistance? </li>
<li>What role does the critical water potential
seem to play in producing this relationship? 
Can you explain the reason for this?</li>
<li>Noting the variation in leaf water potential
when you obtain the linear agreement, why does 
the latter not seem to vary much? If you were an
experimenter and your error bars were 0.5-1.0
bar in measuring the leaf water potential, what 
might you incorrectly conclude about the sensitivity 
of stomatal resistance to leaf water potential?</li>
</ol>


<a name="L2S2"></a>
<em>Simulation 2</em>

<p>Return to your simulations in which you induced
a mid day 'stomatal closure' (a significant 
elevation of stomatal resistance at mid day due to 
reduced root zone soil water content). Rerun these 
simulations with two differing input values of Zp 
(one high and one low) to simulate the effects of 
a high and low ozone concentration; (choose these 
two values as representing the extreme values in 
the above table). Choose a high and a low ozone 
concentration (say 0.12 and 0.04 ppmv) for these 
two cases. Now assess whether the plant will be 
better off in terms of water use efficiency, 
assimilation rate and ozone intake if it were 
shaded as if the sky were completely overcast. 
To assess the effect of shading, run another set 
of simulations with the same parameters but with
a cloud factor representative of an overcast 
sky. The point here is that shading will increase 
stomatal resistance by reducing photon intake and
therefore reduce photosynthesis, but, at the same 
time, it will reduce the transpiration and therefore
reduce the water stress on the plant. Be sure to
compare the stomatal resistance and leaf water 
potential values at mid day for the unshaded and 
shaded series of simulations.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, vary the root zone
soil water content to find the conditions under
which shading of the plant during dry periods 
of high ozone concentration may improve the 
productivity. If this works out you might want
to try varying Zp to simulate a variation in 
ozone concentration and find the range of soil
water content an ozone concentrations for which 
shading will benefit the plant.

<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 13</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a>
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Like carbon dioxide, other gases are ingested into plants, 
some of which are harmful. One of these harmful gases is ozone, 
which is produced by photon flux interaction with pollutants, 
mainly auto emissions. Although the mechanism by which ozone
destroys plant tissue is still being studied, its presence has
undeniable effects in damaging plant leaves. As such, ozone 
looms as an important economic factor in biomass production, and
studies are underway to determine the effect of ozone on both 
corn and soybeans. The molecular weight of ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is 48 
grams per mole. Not only is the molecular weight of ozone similar
to that of carbon dioxide (44 g), but the molecular diffusivity
in air and its density is also very similar. Thus, in principle,
it is a simple matter to calculate ozone flux to the mesophyll
using an analogous equation to 12.2, but with the ambient 
concentration of ozone replacing that of carbon dioxide, and the
internal contact concentration of ozone as zero. Typical 
ambient ozone concentrations vary between about 0.04 ppmv for a
relatively unpolluted atmosphere to about 0.12 ppmv for a 
polluted atmosphere (Los Angeles!). Thus, ozone concentrations 
are more than a thousand times smaller than that of carbon dioxide. </p>

<p>Unlike the carbon dioxide fluxes, however, ozone has a sink
at the ground surface as well as in the leaves. Since the
cuticular resistance is typically many times that of the 
stomatal resistance, most of the ozone ingested by the leaf is
through the stomates. However, an approximately equal flux 
is deposited at the ground surface in and around a plant canopy. 
Typical fluxes to the leaves are between 0.3 and 0.8 micrograms 
per square meter per second for a LAI of 3. Maximum fluxes tend
to occur during the afternoon in association with the reduced
stomatal and air resistances. Recent studies show that the
effect of ozone on the leaves is to increase the plant stem/root 
hydraulic resistance, which results in an increase in stomatal
resistance as well. Accordingly, not only does the ozone 
destroy leaf tissue, but also the plant restricts the intake 
of carbon dioxide, which is used to make plant material. 
Perhaps the plant is trying to protect itself by also 
restricting the intake of ozone. This might compensate somewhat
for the increased intake of ozone and its attendant 
destruction of leaf material. Obviously, in view of the damage
inflicted by ozone on crops, this buffering strategy by the
plant is only partially successful.</p>

<p>
Although ozone (O<sub>3</sub>) is essential for filtering out harmful
ultraviolet rays at 20 km above the earth's surface, where 
the gas is produced by the action of photons on oxygen 
molecules, it is a harmful gas if absorbed by living things. 
Ozone is also produced near the surface by the action of 
photons on the by-products of burnt fossil fuels. While this 
problem is most acute in places like California, ozone levels
in State College do occasionally reach or exceed the maximum
recommended level of safety recently specified by the EPA 
-- 80 parts per billion by volume (0.08 ppmv). Daily variations 
in ozone concentration depend on the solar insolation, 
turbulent mixing of the atmosphere, and the level of traffic.
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch10.html">Figure 10.1</a> shows a typical example of the daytime variation 
in ozone concentration at the top of Walker Bldg during a 
week in early summer in 1995.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch13_files/13.gif" alt="figure 13.1"></p>

<p>
A large range of sensitivity to ozone exists in 
commercial plants and trees. Black Cherry is known to be 
sensitive to ozone, white ash is somewhat sensitive and red
maple is tolerant. Studies on commercially grown plants in
California, such as cotton and grapes, show that conform
that ozone has a deleterious effect on plant growth and 
biomass production. Evidence suggests that the adverse 
effects of ozone are brought about by a reduction in root 
mass in relation to leaf area, accompanied by a reduction 
of stomatal conductance and intake of carbon. Yields of
cotton in the San Joaquin Valley of California are reduced 
about 20% by exposure to ozone produced near the surface.
Indeed, much larger declines in plant productivity have been
observed during exposure to ozone by wheat and pea plants
and in oak trees. 
</p>

<a name="here"></a>

<p>Exposure to ozone is known to increase stomatal resistance
(decrease stomatal conductance), with response times for 
the stomates on the order of a few hours or less. This response
is especially rapid in older leaves, although younger ones 
may actually increase their stomatal conductance for a short
time in response to the failure of the older leaves to 
photosynthesize. It follows that a greater ingestion of ozone
will occur, all other things being equal, in dryer soils in
which the plants may exhibit a higher stomatal resistance
than in the wet soils. <a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a> </p>

<p>Intake of ozone into plants is accomplished primarily 
through the stomata and an overall increase in stomatal 
resistance occurs over the whole plant when exposed to ozone. 
This increase in stomatal resistance in response to the ozone
intake is not sufficient to eliminate the destruction of
leaf material which remain exposed to ingested ozone. Moreover,
the effect of ozone on the more sensitive leaves remains for
many hours or days after the exposure has been removed. Reduced 
intake of both carbon dioxide and ozone and the destruction of
leaf material constitute separate but equally detrimental
effects of ozone exposure to plants. The effect of ozone exposure
on the root growth is slower and at longer term.</p>

<p>The question has been asked: what are the mechanisms by 
which ozone affects plant well being? Evidence suggests that
the intake of ozone through the stomates is the primary 
mechanism for the limitation of carbon intake. Nevertheless, 
intake of ozone through the cuticle can result in ozone reaction
with plant material. Indeed, it appears that the destruction
of ozone (and its return to oxygen) occurs when the latter 
strikes reactive surfaces including water. Thus, ozone 
destruction can occur at the ground in and around plants, 
although a ground sink of ozone may depend on its wetness.
There is evidence to suggest that ozone is blocked from
entering the stomates when the leaves are wet, such as during
the morning when dew lies on the plants.</p>

<a name="one"></a>
<p>1.) The reverse has been found in some experiments with Black
Cherry, although this completely unexpected result has not
yet been explained. </p>


<a name="ozone"></a>
<h2>Ozone effects on hydraulic and stomatal resistance</h2>

<p>A strong positive correlation has been demonstrated between
stomatal resistance (r<sub>st</sub>) and hydraulic conductivity (Zp) of the 
root-stem complex in cotton plants. Normally, Zp (also referred 
to as the xylem resistance) varies with the age and type of the
plant, but it also varies with the general health of the plant.
For ozone, laboratory experiments show that stomatal conductance
and hydraulic conductance diminish almost linearly with ozone 
concentration for 12-hour exposures in cotton plants. These same
studies also present the puzzling result that the mid day 
(minimum) leaf water potential remains almost constant (typically
at about -14 bar) with varying ozone concentration. When plotted
one against the other, hydraulic conductance varies almost
linearly with stomatal conductance.</p>

<p>Stomatal conductance (or resistance) varies considerably 
over the course of a single day, and even from day to day
depending on the amount of insolation. Yet hydraulic
conductance is found to vary slowly with time; it may, 
for example, gradually diminish over the course of a week 
or two as the plant undergoes senescence or starts to suffer
from water stress. Clearly, stomatal resistance depends on 
external and internal factors, among them hydraulic 
conductivity. Thus, if the latter is varied, stomatal 
resistance must adjust. </p>

<p>Recalling the equations governing the fluxes of water 
and water vapor, it is possible to describe, by combining 
the transpiration equation (12.3) and the hydraulic 
conductivity equation (10.3), the <em>steady state</em> flow of water 
uptake and transpiration by a plant. In this case, it can be
shown mathematically that stomatal resistance is dependent
on the choice of the plant hydraulic resistance (Zp) (or 
its inverse, the plant hydraulic conductance (Gp)). Using 
the aforementioned equation, which we have seen is contained
within the model, the calculated stomatal resistance varies
almost linearly with changing Zp, fitting the observations 
almost exactly. Since Zp increases in direct proportion to 
ozone concentration over a wide range of concentrations, one
can deduce that stomatal resistance will increase in direct
proportion to the ozone concentration.</p>

<p>As we have seen in the previous chapter, a doubling of
r<sub>st</sub> will not necessarily halve the carbon assimilation rate,
<strong><em>A</em></strong>, unless the other resistances in the denominator of the 
resistance equation were zero (which they are not!). Regardless
of this mechanistic relationship, the close correspondence 
under many conditions between xylem hydraulic conductance and 
gas exchange performance suggests that alteration of root 
properties by ozone exposure may be expected to exert harmful
effects on shoot (leaf) and canopy gas exchange. By reducing
the leaf area, an increase in ozone implicitly affects Zp. 
In real plants, the reduction in leaf area due to ozone exposure 
is due to the fact that more leaves remain on the plant than can
be supported by the roots. These leaves suffer both the chemical
poisoning by ozone but also a desiccation due to their 
inability to sustain transpiration. Thus the leaves shrivel, 
die and fall off. One could argue that the reduction in root 
conductance, which accompanies ozone exposure as well, is a 
protective mechanism to reduce ozone intake by increasing stomatal
resistance. The net result is a reduction in biomass not 
unlike that produced by water stress on the plant.</p>

<a name="changes"></a>
<h2>Changes in leaf water potential due to ozone</h2>

<p>A curious observation made by Grantz (Grantz et al., 1999) is the 
lack of response by the leaf water potential to changing stomatal
resistance induced by variations in ambient ozone concentration. 
A clue to this behavior is found in the values of leaf water 
potential, ψl, which in the cotton experiments were typically about
-14 bar. An increase in Zp will require that, to maintain 
constant transpiration, ψl must decrease still further. If the 
latter is very close to the critical water potential, however, 
a slight decrease in ψl will result in a large increase in r<sub>st</sub>.
Thus, an increase in Zp causes the stomatal resistance to 
increase by triggering a response in the leaves via the critical 
water potential mechanism discussed in previous chapters. Such a
slight decrease in ψl would not be readily measurable within
the accuracy of current techniques (~0.5-1.0 bar), which is
perhaps one reason why a few plant scientists claim that ψl is 
non sensitive to water stress or ozone concentration. If this 
hypothesis that the mechanism operates through the critical water 
potential is correct, the effects of stomatal resistance increase
due to increased ozone concentration should be much more 
apparent at mid day than in the early or mid morning. </p>

<a name="simulations"></a> <h2>Simulations</h2>
<p><strong>Level 1</strong></p>

<p>We assume that the ozone concentration at the interior
of the leaf is zero (unlike that of the internal carbon 
dioxide concentration, Ci, in plant leaves), and that 
all the ozone has broken down into oxygen and has bonded 
in unwanted fashion with the plant material. We set in 
the model the ambient ozone concentration at a level z<sub>a</sub> 
(50 m) to C<sub>oz</sub>; at which the ozone concentrations are 
assumed to be relatively independent of the vegetation. </p>

<p>Values measured by the EPA would be at screen level 
(1.3 m). These will be somewhat lower than the ambient 
values at z<sub>a</sub>. In reality, the near-surface concentrations 
will increase during the morning and decrease during 
the afternoon, in response to increased and then 
decreased photochemical reaction with fossil fuel 
products. We further assume that the flux of ozone from
the air to the stomates is in parallel with that 
through the cuticle, and that the total leaf flux is 
in parallel with that through the cuticle and with
that into the ground, as in the big leaf model
described in chapter 7. Thus, we have three streams
of ozone: one into the stomates, one into the cuticle,
and the other into the ground. Diffusive resistances
for the ground and the leaf surfaces are given by 
the physics of resistance for a flat surface and that
for the stomates by a simple diffusive flux. We
assume further that all the ozone reaching the ground 
is absorbed (probably too extreme as assumption), that
the stomates are one-sided (although cuticles exist 
on both sides) and that a shelter factor P is necessary 
for the stomatal resistance (as explained previously). </p>


<a name="L1S1"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 1:</em></p>

<p><strong>Observe the diurnal behavior of near-surface ozone</strong></p>


<p>Set the value of ambient ozone concentration to
0.08 ppmv, the recommended maximum concentration 
by the EPA. Run the model with the standard set of
values you have used in previous simulations for
corn. Graph the values of ozone at screen level 
(1.5 m). 
</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> At what time of day is the maximum ozone concentration and why?</li>
<li> Why does the concentration of ozone not reach 0.08 ppmv?</li>
<li> Compare the simulated results with the actual
values for State College shown in Figure 1. What 
are some of the reasons for the much more irregular
pattern of changes observed in the latter as
compared with the simulations? </li>
</ol>



<a name="L1S2"></a>
<p><em>Simulation 2</em></p>

<p><strong>Vary the soil moisture, LAI, and wind speed</strong></p>


<p>Vary the root zone soil moisture availability,
the vegetation amount (LAI), and the wind speed 
as you did in the earlier chapters. Now observe 
the differences in ozone concentrations between
these simulations.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li> Describe these the differences in ozone concentration and flux between the high and 
low moisture availability, high and low vegetation amounts and high and low wind 
speeds and try to explain these differences. Recall from earlier chapters how the fluxes
and resistances respond to these changes to help you explain the ozone response.  </li>
<li> Under what atmospheric conditions is the plant/canopy better off as far as minimizing 
its exposure and intake of ozone? Do you think that autohumidification might help the 
plants in this situation as well?</li>
</ol>


<p><strong>Level 2</strong></p>

<p><em>Simulation 1</em>:</p>

<p>Below is a table obtained from measurements 
made in the field over two types of cotton plants.</p>

<p>Table 1. Stomatal conductance versus hydraulic 
conductance as measured in cotton at the University
of California, Kearney Agricultural Center, 
Riverside California (Grantz et al., 1999). 
</p>
<p>Convert the values as given to resistance with 
units of bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> for hydraulic resistance 
and units of s m<sup>-1</sup> for stomatal resistance. To 
do this first take the inverse of the values given
in the table to get the resistances. Then, divide
the hydraulic resistance in the inverse units 
given above by 4.45 and the stomatal resistance 
in the units given above by 0.025. Thus, a value
of 10 units in hydraulic conductivity becomes 
0.1 units in hydraulic resistance and 0.1/4.45 
(or about 0.02) in units of bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>. Similarly 
a stomatal conductance of 0.5 units in the above 
notation becomes 2 units of resistance in the above
notation and 2/0.025 (or 80) in units of s m<sup>-1</sup>. 
</p>
<p>Now, see if you can reproduce these results
using our default sounding for mid-latitude summer.
To do this, vary the hydraulic (xylem) resistance
between 0.025 and 0.055 bar (Wm<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup> at intervals
of 0.010 [i.e., .025 .035 .045 .055]. Assign a 
critical water potential of -30 bar (essentially 
eliminating this variable from play) and note the 
midday stomatal resistance for each. It should 
be obvious that such a low critical leaf water 
potential is never reached and therefore stomatal 
resistance does not change. Now, lower the
critical leaf water potential at you own discretion, 
and try to duplicate the results in the table above.
 Do not expect to match the values exactly, but try
and get a similar linear agreement between the 
hydraulic and stomatal resistances. (Hint: you may
begin to see agreement with the observations when
you the critical water potential is between -15
and -20 bar.) Graph the leaf water potential 
versus time for each when you get agreement with 
the table.
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Can you reproduce the linear relationship 
between stomatal and hydraulic resistance? </li>
<li>What role does the critical water potential
seem to play in producing this relationship? 
Can you explain the reason for this?</li>
<li>Noting the variation in leaf water potential
when you obtain the linear agreement, why does 
the latter not seem to vary much? If you were an
experimenter and your error bars were 0.5-1.0
bar in measuring the leaf water potential, what 
might you incorrectly conclude about the sensitivity 
of stomatal resistance to leaf water potential?</li>
</ol>


<a name="L2S2"></a>
<em>Simulation 2</em>

<p>Return to your simulations in which you induced
a mid day 'stomatal closure' (a significant 
elevation of stomatal resistance at mid day due to 
reduced root zone soil water content). Rerun these 
simulations with two differing input values of Zp 
(one high and one low) to simulate the effects of 
a high and low ozone concentration; (choose these 
two values as representing the extreme values in 
the above table). Choose a high and a low ozone 
concentration (say 0.12 and 0.04 ppmv) for these 
two cases. Now assess whether the plant will be 
better off in terms of water use efficiency, 
assimilation rate and ozone intake if it were 
shaded as if the sky were completely overcast. 
To assess the effect of shading, run another set 
of simulations with the same parameters but with
a cloud factor representative of an overcast 
sky. The point here is that shading will increase 
stomatal resistance by reducing photon intake and
therefore reduce photosynthesis, but, at the same 
time, it will reduce the transpiration and therefore
reduce the water stress on the plant. Be sure to
compare the stomatal resistance and leaf water 
potential values at mid day for the unshaded and 
shaded series of simulations.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, vary the root zone
soil water content to find the conditions under
which shading of the plant during dry periods 
of high ozone concentration may improve the 
productivity. If this works out you might want
to try varying Zp to simulate a variation in 
ozone concentration and find the range of soil
water content an ozone concentrations for which 
shading will benefit the plant.
