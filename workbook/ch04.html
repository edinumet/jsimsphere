<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 4</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We all know, or think we know, what inertia is. If something or somebody is reluctant to move in the face of an outside
force, we call that inertia. If a body is heated externally, <em>e.g.</em>, by the sun, but does not change its temperature
very rapidly, that body can be said to have a large thermal inertia. In the absence of all surface fluxes except the
sensible heat flux into the atmosphere (H) and the heat flux into the soil (G), the <em>amplitude of the daily temperature
wave</em> (the maximum and minimum temperatures reached in a 24-hour period) is a crude measure of the thermal inertia. The
greater and more rapid the change in daily temperatures, the smaller the thermal inertia of the surface.
</p>
<p>An important factor in the ability of an object to change temperature is called <em>heat capacity</em>. The quantity of
heat required to raise the temperature of a system by a certain amount is a measure of the heat capacity of a system,
commonly expressed in units of Joules per kg per degree K. The higher an objects' heat capacity, the longer it will take
to increase its temperature given a certain amount of applied heat. The change in temperature of a mass due to an input
of Q Joules of heat per kg of mass per second is expressed in <a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.1</a>, where C' is the heat
capacity and DT a temperature change.
</p>
<p>Heat capacity is not the whole story behind thermal inertia, however, because it does not tell us how the temperature
will rise if heat is applied to a boundary of a system, such as the ground surface for example, because the amount of
heat conducted into a material depends on its <em>thermal conductivity</em>. If the sun heats a square of ground surface,
the rate of heat conducted into the ground depends upon the thermal conductivity and the temperature gradient of the soil
just beneath the surface. This is expressed by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.2</a>, where
λ' is the soil thermal conductivity, Δz a distance interval in the ground and
ΔT a temperature change.
</p>
<p>Thermal inertia also differs from heat capacity in the following: If a body is large and the heat applied externally 
on the surface, the change in temperature of the material depends not only on the heat capacity and conductivity, but 
also on the rate at which heat can be diffused from the surface to the interior or from the interior to the surface. 
Therefore, thermal inertia is dependent on any two of the following three parameters: heat capacity, thermal conductivity 
and <em>thermal diffusivity</em>.
</p>
<p>Clearly, how much the substrate temperature rises depends on how rapidly the heat diffuses in the ground, as well as 
on how rapidly the heat is conducted through the surface into the substrate. The ability of a medium to diffuse heat is 
given by its thermal diffusivity, <img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is defined for the soil as
<img src="ch04_files/soildiff.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> where λ' is the soil 
conductivity, C is the heat ρ' is the soil density. 
</p>
<p>Because the vertical gradient of the heat flux G in a one-dimensional vertical column of soil is proportional to the 
rate of change with time in heat content Q (in Joules per kg per second) of the material, we can combine 
<a href="#equations">Eqn 4.1</a> and <a href="#equations">4.2</a> to yield the familiar Fickian diffusion 
equation, (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.3</a>) which is one of the most useful, if not overworked, equations in 
science and engineering. In our model, it serves as the basis for computing the rate of change of temperature in the 
soil. (You might want to consult the passages recommended in one of the four references listed below for a slightly more 
detailed discussion of the diffusion equation.) 
</p>
<p>Soils have a wide range of thermal diffusivities, thermal conductivities, and densities. Remember, however, that two 
of the following three parameters, λ' and <img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> 
and C', are independent thermal parameters, meaning that any one of these can be figured out from the other two. For 
convenience, we limit ourselves to a discussion of just thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity with regards to 
their impact on thermal inertia.
</p>
<p>Theoretical studies show that if one applies a periodic heating at the surface of a semi-infinite medium such as a 
column of soil, the rate of heat flux into the substrate is proportional to a quantity 


<img src="ch04_files/substrate1.gif" alt="substrate" style="vertical-align: middle;">, which is also equal to <img src="ch04_files/substrate2.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">
[<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.4</a>]; (also see p. 139 of Sellers's book). This quantity is called the <em>thermal 
inertia</em> <strong>P</strong>, although it has various other names, such as the <em>conductive capacity</em> or <em>thermal 
property</em>. A small thermal inertia results in a small influx of heat, G, into the substrate and a larger surface 
temperature rise. Since the nighttime cooling at the surface is partly dependent on the supply of heat from below, a 
smaller thermal inertia can also result in a greater nighttime cooling due to lack of heat storage in deeper layers of 
the soil.
</p>
<p>Thermal inertia is expressed in the model in cgs units. These units are <img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. 
Typical values for most natural soils and urban materials range from 0.02 to 0.06 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. This is a somewhat ungainly quantity, so an artifact has been developed 
called the Thermal Inertia Unit, (or TIU). Let us examine the derivation of TIU. First let us arbitrarily take the square 
root daily period <img src="ch04_files/dailyperiod.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> and divide it into P. The purpose in using a totally 
irrelevant parameter, <img src="ch04_files/w.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, the earth's rotation rate, is simply to remove the 
square root from the time units in the expression for P. The resultant unit is 
<img src="ch04_files/units2.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Further dividing by 4.184 Joules per calorie and multiplying by 10 000 square 
cm per square meter yields a much simpler and more familiar set of units in SI notation, 357 W m<sup>-2</sup> 
K<sup>-1</sup> per <img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. So 35.7 TIU is equal to 0.1 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is a fairly large value, and 1 TIU is equal to about 0.003 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is exceedingly small. Because many old tables express thermal inertia 
in cgs, we will use this system for expressing thermal inertia in the model, and simply forget how awful the units are! 
The user, however, can input the thermal inertia in TIU. For most natural surfaces, the value of TIU is between 4 and 30. 
In real soils, TIU also varies with soil water content. For dry soil, the TIU is about 6 units and for soil at field 
capacity it is about 28 TIU. Although the model will not permit the user to exceed reasonable bounds for TIU, we 
recommend that values not be set below 6 or above about 30. 
</p>

<a name="applications"></a>
<h2>Applications of the Thermal Inertia concept</h2>


<p>A theoretical implication of the diffusion equation is that, given an external periodic heating of the surface, 
the amplitude of surface temperature (twice the difference between the maximum and minimum surface temperature) is 
related to the type of surface composition. This idea first appealed (during the 1970's) to certain geologists, who were 
looking for ways to classify land surface properties using the surface infrared temperature, which can be measured from a 
satellite. (Note that the <strong>Manual of Remote Sensing</strong> lists the thermal inertia for different types of soils and 
materials.) These geologists attempted to use the measurements of surface temperature to determine the mineral properties 
of the soil, first on the moon and later on earth. They were later to abandon the idea because they discovered that 
surface moisture and vegetation scrambled up the measurements in a way that quite limited their usefulness. 
</p>
<p>A background on the development of the thermal inertia concept can be found on the first three pages of Price's (1982) 
article, listed below. Price attempts to go beyond an earlier concept called apparent thermal inertia, which was just a 
simple measure of the diurnal surface temperature amplitude. He introduces the concept of a <em>diurnal heat capacity</em> 
D, for which he derives a complex expression in terms of the diurnal surface temperature amplitude. So constituted, 
Price's analytical expression for D (which is P scaled by the earth's rotation rate) contains terms that relate the 
temperature wave to other parameters, such as soil moisture, wind speed and roughness length. Price's articles followed 
the launching of a satellite during the late 1970s, called the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM). The HCMM was 
supposed to provide a measure of the surface thermal inertia pattern, but its full promise was never fully achieved, 
partly because of the short duration of the satellite's life span (1 yr.) and partly because the surface, with its 
vegetation cover, turned out to be even more complex than most people had anticipated. Like the Geologists, the 
Meteorologists found themselves in trouble in underestimating the complexity of the earth's surface! It remained for 
the 'third wave', the plant scientists and agronomists, to hurl themselves into the breach. However, things got somewhat 
better at this point because of the reduced importance of P in the vegetation problem. Indeed, when we come to vegetation 
it can be demonstrated that the effect of P diminishes with increasing vegetation amount.
</p>
<p>Yet the impression that the radiant surface temperature contained valuable information pertaining to the land surface 
properties persisted. In Price's thermal inertia model the amplitude of the daily temperature wave is a measure of the 
inertia of the atmosphere to solar heating, the larger the amplitude the smaller the inertia and vice versa. Since the 
largest fluctuation in surface temperature due to solar heating is at the ground, the surface temperature will contain the 
greatest information about the surface properties. The maximum fluctuation in surface temperature is approximately 
between 2 AM and 2 PM, approximately the times of some satellite overpasses. Carlson et al. (1981) were able to derive 
values of thermal inertia for the land surface using satellite measurements of radiant surface temperatures at about 2 AM 
and 2 PM from the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission Satellite data.
</p>

<a name="thermal"></a>
<h2>Thermal Inertia in SimSphere</h2>

<p>
The SimSphere model is interactive and does not assume a sinusoidal variation in solar forcing. It is nevertheless 
possible to demonstrate the theoretical result from analytical but simpler models that thermal inertia is somewhat more 
fundamental to the diurnal temperature wave than thermal conductivity and diffusivity are by themselves. By that we mean 
that if thermal conductivity and diffusivity are varied independently but keeping the thermal inertia constant the 
simulated temperature wave is very nearly unchanged, so long as extreme values of any of these parameters are avoided. 
We also allow P to depend on soil water content according to a formula that seemed to allow the best results. Specifying 
a zero thermal inertia allows the model to determine its own value by this formula. The user may override the default 
treatment of P by inserting something other than a value of zero for thermal inertia. 
</p>
<p>The SimSphere model uses both a soil thermal conductivity and a thermal diffusivity, (which are assumed to have the same 
values throughout), but it obtains these parameters from the specification of thermal inertia alone. The justification 
for using one parameter to generate two is as follows: If one plots λ' versus 
<img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> for a wide variety of natural soils and materials (e.g., as taken from the <strong>Manual 
of Remote Sensing</strong>), one finds that the two parameters are highly correlated. Accordingly, we have used this 
correlative relationship to compute a thermal conductivity and diffusivity, given a thermal inertia supplied by the user. 
This statistical device somewhat reduces the necessity to guess at values which are scarcely known. 
</p>

<a name="precipitable"></a>
<h2>Precipitable Water</h2>

<p>Another important parameter that profoundly affects nighttime cooling is the <em>downwelling long wave (thermal) 
radiation</em> [<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch02.html#equations">Eqn. 2.1</a>]. This is expressed by the formula, given by 
<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.5</a>, which relates the downwelling thermal radiation to the <em>emissivity</em> of the 
atmosphere <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> (nominally at a temperature 
<img src="ch04_files/tbar.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is 
representative of a layer not far above the surface, <em>e.g.</em>, 50 or 150 m). Recall that the emissivity is the ratio of 
the actual thermal radiation to the blackbody radiation temperature, <img src="ch04_files/tbar.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Since the principal 
absorber in the atmosphere is not the air but the water vapor (and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide), the emissivity 
of the atmosphere (<img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">) is made a function of the precipitable water (W) in the 
atmosphere, which is the equivalent depth of liquid water in a column of air if all the vapor were condensed out as 
rainfall. Typically, the precipitable water amount is between 1 and 3 cm. 
</p>
<p>The simple use of precipitable water in the formula for downwelling thermal radiation expresses the relationship 
between the amount of <em>absorber</em> (water vapor) and emissivity; alternately stated, the more water vapor in the 
atmosphere the closer the atmosphere resembles a black body, <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> = 1.0. Since most of 
the water vapor in the atmosphere is close to the surface (i.e. the lowest 2 - 3 km), the effective radiating temperature 
will be that in the lower atmosphere. Increasing the precipitable water increases the downward long wave flux 
<img src="ch04_files/ldown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> and therefore retards the nocturnal cooling. 
</p>
<p>To this point, we are still talking of clear skies. The atmosphere can be simulated as a blackbody radiator by 
arbitrarily increasing the precipitable water such that the emissivity of the atmosphere approaches 1.0. However, the 
condition that <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> = 1.0 can also occur, in effect, with the presence of dense, 
low cloud cover. A cloud layer effectively makes the atmosphere a blackbody radiator at the temperature of the cloud base. 
If low enough, that emitting surface may have a temperature not far from that of the ground surface, in which case the 
net upward minus downward long wave radiation may be very close to zero. Of course, to simulate clouds during the day we 
would also need to reduce the incoming solar flux by a factor appropriate to whatever type and amount.
</p>

<a name="simulations"></a>
<h2>Simulations</h2>


<a name="l1"></a>
<strong>Simulations (Level 1)</strong>

<p>
In this chapter we will begin looking quite extensively at the behavior of nighttime temperatures and 
fluxes. Remember to extend the 'end time of the run' out to 5 AM in order to simulate the entire nighttime 
(24 hour) period.
</p>


<a name="l1s1"></a>
<em>Simulation series 1</em>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary only the thermal inertia</strong>
<p>Soil type and condition is a large determinate of the thermal inertia of a surface. The Barrens, near State College, PA, 
boasts one of the largest amplitude temperature waves in the area, particularly on winter nights. This is primarily due 
to the sandy soil type of the Barrens, which typically has values near 6 TIU. Wet, loamy soils may have values about 
18 -24 TIU. Many types of urban materials have values of P ranging from 6 to 24 TIU, but the old adage that urban 
materials are better conductors than rural soils is not supported by measurements shown in various tables (<em>e.g.</em> 
the <strong>Manual of Remote Sensing</strong>). (A note for the future: the type of soil one chooses is critical for the plant 
simulations. This choice is affected by indicating the soil type. It is best to make sure in these later simulations that 
the value of P, if chosen by the user, conforms to the type of soil selected for the plant modules.) 
</p>
<p>Thus, if a non-zero value of P is chosen, the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the soil are calculated 
internally in the model, and is independent of the soil moisture. A choice of zero, however, means that P is not 
independent of M<sub>o</sub>, and is calculated accordingly. However, making P dependent on M limits our ability to 
investigate the variation in P over urban surfaces, where the material more than the substrate water content determine 
the value of P. 
</p>
<p>The simulations to this point have been run using a standard value of thermal inertia equal to 12 TIU. Make a default 
run, followed by some simulations with varying thermal inertia. Try and keep the values between 6 and 30 TIU, as the 
model may explode if given numbers out of this range. Concentrate on the surface flux output, including the ground flux, 
as well as the surface temperatures.</p>
</li>
</ul>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What do you observe about the daily temperature curve as P is varied?</li>
<li>Is the effect of changing P on surface air or radiant temperature more dramatic at night than during the day?</li>
<li>Examine the differences in the Bowen ratio throughout the day. Which of the surface fluxes appears to be most 
greatly affected by a change in thermal inertia?</li>
<li>Try a very low value of P (= 5 TIU), simulating the Barrens environment. Why does the model yield such low nighttime 
temperatures under these circumstances? What is missing in the model that is present in the real world, and would control 
the rapid temperature decrease?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l1s2"></a>
<em>Simulation series 2</em>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the thermal inertia and the surface moisture availability</strong>

<p>Make simulations using a thermal inertia of 6, 12, and 18 TIU under different surface moisture environments
(M<sub>o</sub> = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). Again, look at the surface fluxes and temperatures in your output.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How does P affect the Bowen ratio for differing values of M<sub>o</sub>? </li> 
<li>Does the thermal inertia change the sensible heat flux more for dry or wet surfaces? Pay particular attention to 
the ground flux. </li>
<li>How is the ground flux affected by an increase in P and why? </li>
<li>How does a changing P affect the moisture availability itself? </li>
<li>Why does the daytime surface temperature response to P differ from that a night so significantly?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l1s3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 3</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the precipitable water</strong>

<p>Vary the precipitable water (and, in effect, the atmospheric emissivity), and note how these changes affect the 
nighttime temperature. The standard value used to this point is 3.13 cm. Run the default case, then perform a simulation 
with a large value of <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> (<em>e.g.</em>, 0.9) by increasing the precipitable water to a 
large value such as 5 cm. 
</p>
<p>Next, try a low value, less than 1 cm, concentrating once again on the daily temperature cycle and surface fluxes. 
</p>
<p>Alternately, you can vary the cloud cover, if you wish. Note that this change will also affect incoming solar flux 
during the day, as mentioned. Make the cloud cover parameter equal to some fraction, e.g., 1.0 (100%). Unless you have 
time or inclination, do not expend more effort on the precipitable water/cloud issue by performing more than for one or 
two simulations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What similarity to thermal inertia does precipitable water have insofar as the daily temperature wave is concerned?</li>
<li>At what range of W are the most drastic temperature variations seen (low or high values)? </li>
<li>Does the effect of a low W counteract the effect of a high P at night (and vice-versa)? In other words, does 
precipitable water exert a greater control on the daily temperature wave than thermal inertia does for a given fraction 
of its likely range?</li>
<li>Given that clear, calm nights are also nights in which the air is dry (low precipitable water), what would you 
conclude would happen to the night time temperatures on clear, calm nights. To check this out further than you did in 
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch02.html">Chapter 2</a>, run a simulation exactly as you did in that chapter but with a low value 
of TIU. </li>
<li>Given your simulation in question 4, can you produce a sub freezing temperature for the summertime, mid latitude 
sounding at night, such as occasionally happens in the State College barrens in summer?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l2"></a>
<p><strong>Simulations (Level 2)</strong></p>

<p>Up to this point, we have been using the standard vertical profile of winds, temperature, and moisture for the 
summertime mid latitude sounding. Now, think about a location such as Florida compared to a desert region. Florida is 
characterized by high humidity throughout the year due the fact that it is surrounded by warm water, and its daily 
temperature wave does not vary more than 20°F on most occasions. The desert Southwest, however, is known for its large 
amplitude temperature wave, reaching high temperatures well over 100 F and then plummeting down to the 40s at night. It 
might be easy to explain this away due to the longwave cooling at night and low precipitable water of the desert, but that 
is not the whole story. Think about what other factors make the desert SW so hot during the day, yet so cool at night. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Run simulations using a desert sounding and compare it to that of a Florida-type sounding. Consider all the factors 
we have discussed through Chapter 4, including M<sub>o</sub>, surface fluxes, wind speed, thermal inertia, and 
precipitable water. Also, hypothesize on how other variables which we haven't discussed yet could play a role, such as 
soil type, atmospheric humidity, and vegetation. Also, think about the region you live in; what physical parameters that
we have discussed most greatly influence your overall climate?</li>
<li>Let's say I own a very large field of very short vegetation (and therefore I can, for the sake of these simulations,
ignore vegetation for the present) and I wish to prevent the night time temperatures from reaching freezing. If I wet the
surface layer of the ground with water so as to make Mo equal to 1.0 will I get a higher night time temperature than if
I leave the surface dry (M<sub>o</sub> = 0.1). In approaching this problem you will want to make the thermal inertial
large for the wet case and small for the dry case. Explore the possibilities of wetting the surface with both a mid
latitude and a tropical sounding. Never mind that the tropical sound may not exhibit low night time temperatures, as it
pertains to a summertime situation; just examine the behavior of the night time temperatures and compare the various
cases you have chosen. Or, you can introduce your own sounding appropriate of a December sounding over northern Florida
during December.</li>

<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 4</h1>

<a name="introduction"></a> <h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We all know, or think we know, what inertia is. If something or somebody is reluctant to move in the face of an outside
force, we call that inertia. If a body is heated externally, <em>e.g.</em>, by the sun, but does not change its temperature
very rapidly, that body can be said to have a large thermal inertia. In the absence of all surface fluxes except the
sensible heat flux into the atmosphere (H) and the heat flux into the soil (G), the <em>amplitude of the daily temperature
wave</em> (the maximum and minimum temperatures reached in a 24-hour period) is a crude measure of the thermal inertia. The
greater and more rapid the change in daily temperatures, the smaller the thermal inertia of the surface.
</p>
<p>An important factor in the ability of an object to change temperature is called <em>heat capacity</em>. The quantity of
heat required to raise the temperature of a system by a certain amount is a measure of the heat capacity of a system,
commonly expressed in units of Joules per kg per degree K. The higher an objects' heat capacity, the longer it will take
to increase its temperature given a certain amount of applied heat. The change in temperature of a mass due to an input
of Q Joules of heat per kg of mass per second is expressed in <a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.1</a>, where C' is the heat
capacity and DT a temperature change.
</p>
<p>Heat capacity is not the whole story behind thermal inertia, however, because it does not tell us how the temperature
will rise if heat is applied to a boundary of a system, such as the ground surface for example, because the amount of
heat conducted into a material depends on its <em>thermal conductivity</em>. If the sun heats a square of ground surface,
the rate of heat conducted into the ground depends upon the thermal conductivity and the temperature gradient of the soil
just beneath the surface. This is expressed by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.2</a>, where
λ' is the soil thermal conductivity, Δz a distance interval in the ground and
ΔT a temperature change.
</p>
<p>Thermal inertia also differs from heat capacity in the following: If a body is large and the heat applied externally 
on the surface, the change in temperature of the material depends not only on the heat capacity and conductivity, but 
also on the rate at which heat can be diffused from the surface to the interior or from the interior to the surface. 
Therefore, thermal inertia is dependent on any two of the following three parameters: heat capacity, thermal conductivity 
and <em>thermal diffusivity</em>.
</p>
<p>Clearly, how much the substrate temperature rises depends on how rapidly the heat diffuses in the ground, as well as 
on how rapidly the heat is conducted through the surface into the substrate. The ability of a medium to diffuse heat is 
given by its thermal diffusivity, <img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is defined for the soil as
<img src="ch04_files/soildiff.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> where λ' is the soil 
conductivity, C is the heat ρ' is the soil density. 
</p>
<p>Because the vertical gradient of the heat flux G in a one-dimensional vertical column of soil is proportional to the 
rate of change with time in heat content Q (in Joules per kg per second) of the material, we can combine 
<a href="#equations">Eqn 4.1</a> and <a href="#equations">4.2</a> to yield the familiar Fickian diffusion 
equation, (<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.3</a>) which is one of the most useful, if not overworked, equations in 
science and engineering. In our model, it serves as the basis for computing the rate of change of temperature in the 
soil. (You might want to consult the passages recommended in one of the four references listed below for a slightly more 
detailed discussion of the diffusion equation.) 
</p>
<p>Soils have a wide range of thermal diffusivities, thermal conductivities, and densities. Remember, however, that two 
of the following three parameters, λ' and <img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> 
and C', are independent thermal parameters, meaning that any one of these can be figured out from the other two. For 
convenience, we limit ourselves to a discussion of just thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity with regards to 
their impact on thermal inertia.
</p>
<p>Theoretical studies show that if one applies a periodic heating at the surface of a semi-infinite medium such as a 
column of soil, the rate of heat flux into the substrate is proportional to a quantity 


<img src="ch04_files/substrate1.gif" alt="substrate" style="vertical-align: middle;">, which is also equal to <img src="ch04_files/substrate2.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">
[<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.4</a>]; (also see p. 139 of Sellers's book). This quantity is called the <em>thermal 
inertia</em> <strong>P</strong>, although it has various other names, such as the <em>conductive capacity</em> or <em>thermal 
property</em>. A small thermal inertia results in a small influx of heat, G, into the substrate and a larger surface 
temperature rise. Since the nighttime cooling at the surface is partly dependent on the supply of heat from below, a 
smaller thermal inertia can also result in a greater nighttime cooling due to lack of heat storage in deeper layers of 
the soil.
</p>
<p>Thermal inertia is expressed in the model in cgs units. These units are <img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. 
Typical values for most natural soils and urban materials range from 0.02 to 0.06 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. This is a somewhat ungainly quantity, so an artifact has been developed 
called the Thermal Inertia Unit, (or TIU). Let us examine the derivation of TIU. First let us arbitrarily take the square 
root daily period <img src="ch04_files/dailyperiod.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> and divide it into P. The purpose in using a totally 
irrelevant parameter, <img src="ch04_files/w.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, the earth's rotation rate, is simply to remove the 
square root from the time units in the expression for P. The resultant unit is 
<img src="ch04_files/units2.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Further dividing by 4.184 Joules per calorie and multiplying by 10 000 square 
cm per square meter yields a much simpler and more familiar set of units in SI notation, 357 W m<sup>-2</sup> 
K<sup>-1</sup> per <img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. So 35.7 TIU is equal to 0.1 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is a fairly large value, and 1 TIU is equal to about 0.003 
<img src="ch04_files/units.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is exceedingly small. Because many old tables express thermal inertia 
in cgs, we will use this system for expressing thermal inertia in the model, and simply forget how awful the units are! 
The user, however, can input the thermal inertia in TIU. For most natural surfaces, the value of TIU is between 4 and 30. 
In real soils, TIU also varies with soil water content. For dry soil, the TIU is about 6 units and for soil at field 
capacity it is about 28 TIU. Although the model will not permit the user to exceed reasonable bounds for TIU, we 
recommend that values not be set below 6 or above about 30. 
</p>

<a name="applications"></a>
<h2>Applications of the Thermal Inertia concept</h2>


<p>A theoretical implication of the diffusion equation is that, given an external periodic heating of the surface, 
the amplitude of surface temperature (twice the difference between the maximum and minimum surface temperature) is 
related to the type of surface composition. This idea first appealed (during the 1970's) to certain geologists, who were 
looking for ways to classify land surface properties using the surface infrared temperature, which can be measured from a 
satellite. (Note that the <strong>Manual of Remote Sensing</strong> lists the thermal inertia for different types of soils and 
materials.) These geologists attempted to use the measurements of surface temperature to determine the mineral properties 
of the soil, first on the moon and later on earth. They were later to abandon the idea because they discovered that 
surface moisture and vegetation scrambled up the measurements in a way that quite limited their usefulness. 
</p>
<p>A background on the development of the thermal inertia concept can be found on the first three pages of Price's (1982) 
article, listed below. Price attempts to go beyond an earlier concept called apparent thermal inertia, which was just a 
simple measure of the diurnal surface temperature amplitude. He introduces the concept of a <em>diurnal heat capacity</em> 
D, for which he derives a complex expression in terms of the diurnal surface temperature amplitude. So constituted, 
Price's analytical expression for D (which is P scaled by the earth's rotation rate) contains terms that relate the 
temperature wave to other parameters, such as soil moisture, wind speed and roughness length. Price's articles followed 
the launching of a satellite during the late 1970s, called the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM). The HCMM was 
supposed to provide a measure of the surface thermal inertia pattern, but its full promise was never fully achieved, 
partly because of the short duration of the satellite's life span (1 yr.) and partly because the surface, with its 
vegetation cover, turned out to be even more complex than most people had anticipated. Like the Geologists, the 
Meteorologists found themselves in trouble in underestimating the complexity of the earth's surface! It remained for 
the 'third wave', the plant scientists and agronomists, to hurl themselves into the breach. However, things got somewhat 
better at this point because of the reduced importance of P in the vegetation problem. Indeed, when we come to vegetation 
it can be demonstrated that the effect of P diminishes with increasing vegetation amount.
</p>
<p>Yet the impression that the radiant surface temperature contained valuable information pertaining to the land surface 
properties persisted. In Price's thermal inertia model the amplitude of the daily temperature wave is a measure of the 
inertia of the atmosphere to solar heating, the larger the amplitude the smaller the inertia and vice versa. Since the 
largest fluctuation in surface temperature due to solar heating is at the ground, the surface temperature will contain the 
greatest information about the surface properties. The maximum fluctuation in surface temperature is approximately 
between 2 AM and 2 PM, approximately the times of some satellite overpasses. Carlson et al. (1981) were able to derive 
values of thermal inertia for the land surface using satellite measurements of radiant surface temperatures at about 2 AM 
and 2 PM from the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission Satellite data.
</p>

<a name="thermal"></a>
<h2>Thermal Inertia in SimSphere</h2>

<p>
The SimSphere model is interactive and does not assume a sinusoidal variation in solar forcing. It is nevertheless 
possible to demonstrate the theoretical result from analytical but simpler models that thermal inertia is somewhat more 
fundamental to the diurnal temperature wave than thermal conductivity and diffusivity are by themselves. By that we mean 
that if thermal conductivity and diffusivity are varied independently but keeping the thermal inertia constant the 
simulated temperature wave is very nearly unchanged, so long as extreme values of any of these parameters are avoided. 
We also allow P to depend on soil water content according to a formula that seemed to allow the best results. Specifying 
a zero thermal inertia allows the model to determine its own value by this formula. The user may override the default 
treatment of P by inserting something other than a value of zero for thermal inertia. 
</p>
<p>The SimSphere model uses both a soil thermal conductivity and a thermal diffusivity, (which are assumed to have the same 
values throughout), but it obtains these parameters from the specification of thermal inertia alone. The justification 
for using one parameter to generate two is as follows: If one plots λ' versus 
<img src="ch04_files/diffusivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> for a wide variety of natural soils and materials (e.g., as taken from the <strong>Manual 
of Remote Sensing</strong>), one finds that the two parameters are highly correlated. Accordingly, we have used this 
correlative relationship to compute a thermal conductivity and diffusivity, given a thermal inertia supplied by the user. 
This statistical device somewhat reduces the necessity to guess at values which are scarcely known. 
</p>

<a name="precipitable"></a>
<h2>Precipitable Water</h2>

<p>Another important parameter that profoundly affects nighttime cooling is the <em>downwelling long wave (thermal) 
radiation</em> [<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch02.html#equations">Eqn. 2.1</a>]. This is expressed by the formula, given by 
<a href="#equations">Eqn. 4.5</a>, which relates the downwelling thermal radiation to the <em>emissivity</em> of the 
atmosphere <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> (nominally at a temperature 
<img src="ch04_files/tbar.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">, which is 
representative of a layer not far above the surface, <em>e.g.</em>, 50 or 150 m). Recall that the emissivity is the ratio of 
the actual thermal radiation to the blackbody radiation temperature, <img src="ch04_files/tbar.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">. Since the principal 
absorber in the atmosphere is not the air but the water vapor (and, to a lesser extent, carbon dioxide), the emissivity 
of the atmosphere (<img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt="">) is made a function of the precipitable water (W) in the 
atmosphere, which is the equivalent depth of liquid water in a column of air if all the vapor were condensed out as 
rainfall. Typically, the precipitable water amount is between 1 and 3 cm. 
</p>
<p>The simple use of precipitable water in the formula for downwelling thermal radiation expresses the relationship 
between the amount of <em>absorber</em> (water vapor) and emissivity; alternately stated, the more water vapor in the 
atmosphere the closer the atmosphere resembles a black body, <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> = 1.0. Since most of 
the water vapor in the atmosphere is close to the surface (i.e. the lowest 2 - 3 km), the effective radiating temperature 
will be that in the lower atmosphere. Increasing the precipitable water increases the downward long wave flux 
<img src="ch04_files/ldown.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> and therefore retards the nocturnal cooling. 
</p>
<p>To this point, we are still talking of clear skies. The atmosphere can be simulated as a blackbody radiator by 
arbitrarily increasing the precipitable water such that the emissivity of the atmosphere approaches 1.0. However, the 
condition that <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> = 1.0 can also occur, in effect, with the presence of dense, 
low cloud cover. A cloud layer effectively makes the atmosphere a blackbody radiator at the temperature of the cloud base. 
If low enough, that emitting surface may have a temperature not far from that of the ground surface, in which case the 
net upward minus downward long wave radiation may be very close to zero. Of course, to simulate clouds during the day we 
would also need to reduce the incoming solar flux by a factor appropriate to whatever type and amount.
</p>

<a name="simulations"></a>
<h2>Simulations</h2>


<a name="l1"></a>
<strong>Simulations (Level 1)</strong>

<p>
In this chapter we will begin looking quite extensively at the behavior of nighttime temperatures and 
fluxes. Remember to extend the 'end time of the run' out to 5 AM in order to simulate the entire nighttime 
(24 hour) period.
</p>


<a name="l1s1"></a>
<em>Simulation series 1</em>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary only the thermal inertia</strong>
<p>Soil type and condition is a large determinate of the thermal inertia of a surface. The Barrens, near State College, PA, 
boasts one of the largest amplitude temperature waves in the area, particularly on winter nights. This is primarily due 
to the sandy soil type of the Barrens, which typically has values near 6 TIU. Wet, loamy soils may have values about 
18 -24 TIU. Many types of urban materials have values of P ranging from 6 to 24 TIU, but the old adage that urban 
materials are better conductors than rural soils is not supported by measurements shown in various tables (<em>e.g.</em> 
the <strong>Manual of Remote Sensing</strong>). (A note for the future: the type of soil one chooses is critical for the plant 
simulations. This choice is affected by indicating the soil type. It is best to make sure in these later simulations that 
the value of P, if chosen by the user, conforms to the type of soil selected for the plant modules.) 
</p>
<p>Thus, if a non-zero value of P is chosen, the thermal conductivity and diffusivity of the soil are calculated 
internally in the model, and is independent of the soil moisture. A choice of zero, however, means that P is not 
independent of M<sub>o</sub>, and is calculated accordingly. However, making P dependent on M limits our ability to 
investigate the variation in P over urban surfaces, where the material more than the substrate water content determine 
the value of P. 
</p>
<p>The simulations to this point have been run using a standard value of thermal inertia equal to 12 TIU. Make a default 
run, followed by some simulations with varying thermal inertia. Try and keep the values between 6 and 30 TIU, as the 
model may explode if given numbers out of this range. Concentrate on the surface flux output, including the ground flux, 
as well as the surface temperatures.</p>
</li>
</ul>



<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What do you observe about the daily temperature curve as P is varied?</li>
<li>Is the effect of changing P on surface air or radiant temperature more dramatic at night than during the day?</li>
<li>Examine the differences in the Bowen ratio throughout the day. Which of the surface fluxes appears to be most 
greatly affected by a change in thermal inertia?</li>
<li>Try a very low value of P (= 5 TIU), simulating the Barrens environment. Why does the model yield such low nighttime 
temperatures under these circumstances? What is missing in the model that is present in the real world, and would control 
the rapid temperature decrease?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l1s2"></a>
<em>Simulation series 2</em>:

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the thermal inertia and the surface moisture availability</strong>

<p>Make simulations using a thermal inertia of 6, 12, and 18 TIU under different surface moisture environments
(M<sub>o</sub> = 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). Again, look at the surface fluxes and temperatures in your output.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>How does P affect the Bowen ratio for differing values of M<sub>o</sub>? </li> 
<li>Does the thermal inertia change the sensible heat flux more for dry or wet surfaces? Pay particular attention to 
the ground flux. </li>
<li>How is the ground flux affected by an increase in P and why? </li>
<li>How does a changing P affect the moisture availability itself? </li>
<li>Why does the daytime surface temperature response to P differ from that a night so significantly?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l1s3"></a>
<p><em>Simulation series 3</em>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Vary the precipitable water</strong>

<p>Vary the precipitable water (and, in effect, the atmospheric emissivity), and note how these changes affect the 
nighttime temperature. The standard value used to this point is 3.13 cm. Run the default case, then perform a simulation 
with a large value of <img src="ch04_files/emissivity.gif" style="vertical-align: middle;" alt=""> (<em>e.g.</em>, 0.9) by increasing the precipitable water to a 
large value such as 5 cm. 
</p>
<p>Next, try a low value, less than 1 cm, concentrating once again on the daily temperature cycle and surface fluxes. 
</p>
<p>Alternately, you can vary the cloud cover, if you wish. Note that this change will also affect incoming solar flux 
during the day, as mentioned. Make the cloud cover parameter equal to some fraction, e.g., 1.0 (100%). Unless you have 
time or inclination, do not expend more effort on the precipitable water/cloud issue by performing more than for one or 
two simulations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>What similarity to thermal inertia does precipitable water have insofar as the daily temperature wave is concerned?</li>
<li>At what range of W are the most drastic temperature variations seen (low or high values)? </li>
<li>Does the effect of a low W counteract the effect of a high P at night (and vice-versa)? In other words, does 
precipitable water exert a greater control on the daily temperature wave than thermal inertia does for a given fraction 
of its likely range?</li>
<li>Given that clear, calm nights are also nights in which the air is dry (low precipitable water), what would you 
conclude would happen to the night time temperatures on clear, calm nights. To check this out further than you did in 
<a href="http://www.e-education.psu.edu/simsphere/workbook/ch02.html">Chapter 2</a>, run a simulation exactly as you did in that chapter but with a low value 
of TIU. </li>
<li>Given your simulation in question 4, can you produce a sub freezing temperature for the summertime, mid latitude 
sounding at night, such as occasionally happens in the State College barrens in summer?</li>
</ol>


<a name="l2"></a>
<p><strong>Simulations (Level 2)</strong></p>

<p>Up to this point, we have been using the standard vertical profile of winds, temperature, and moisture for the 
summertime mid latitude sounding. Now, think about a location such as Florida compared to a desert region. Florida is 
characterized by high humidity throughout the year due the fact that it is surrounded by warm water, and its daily 
temperature wave does not vary more than 20°F on most occasions. The desert Southwest, however, is known for its large 
amplitude temperature wave, reaching high temperatures well over 100 F and then plummeting down to the 40s at night. It 
might be easy to explain this away due to the longwave cooling at night and low precipitable water of the desert, but that 
is not the whole story. Think about what other factors make the desert SW so hot during the day, yet so cool at night. 
</p>

<ol>
<li>Run simulations using a desert sounding and compare it to that of a Florida-type sounding. Consider all the factors 
we have discussed through Chapter 4, including M<sub>o</sub>, surface fluxes, wind speed, thermal inertia, and 
precipitable water. Also, hypothesize on how other variables which we haven't discussed yet could play a role, such as 
soil type, atmospheric humidity, and vegetation. Also, think about the region you live in; what physical parameters that
we have discussed most greatly influence your overall climate?</li>
<li>Let's say I own a very large field of very short vegetation (and therefore I can, for the sake of these simulations,
ignore vegetation for the present) and I wish to prevent the night time temperatures from reaching freezing. If I wet the
surface layer of the ground with water so as to make Mo equal to 1.0 will I get a higher night time temperature than if
I leave the surface dry (M<sub>o</sub> = 0.1). In approaching this problem you will want to make the thermal inertial
large for the wet case and small for the dry case. Explore the possibilities of wetting the surface with both a mid
latitude and a tropical sounding. Never mind that the tropical sound may not exhibit low night time temperatures, as it
pertains to a summertime situation; just examine the behavior of the night time temperatures and compare the various
cases you have chosen. Or, you can introduce your own sounding appropriate of a December sounding over northern Florida
during December.</li>
