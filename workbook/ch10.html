<h1>SimSphere Workbook: Chapter 10</h1>

<a name="preamble"></a>
<h2>Preamble</h2>

<p>We have seen that in a dense vegetation canopy almost all 
the latent heat flux comes from the plants. Just about all of
that comes through the leaves and almost all of that through 
the stomates. Look around you and you will see that the leaves
on most plants are confined to the upper third of the height 
of the plant. Of course, most of the sunlight is trapped in the
upper third of the canopy, so, if you were a plant, why 
bother putting leaves any lower down ? You might well ask: 
why bother to grow so high in the first place, if most of the
leaves are confined to a relatively shallow layer near the 
top ? The answer has to with keeping up with the Jonses, so to
speak. If everyone is growing just a little higher than you 
are in order to steal your sunlight, then you too must grow up
higher to stay in competition for the precious life-giving 
radiation. The bucolic picture of nature as benevolent and peaceful
is misleading. Wall Street has nothing on nature; the 
competition amongst plants in the wild is fierce and deadly,
if not a bit slow and silent. You might say that its a jungle
out there !
</p>

<a name="back"></a>
<p>Yet plants do arrive at compromises, at least within a 
species. Trees of a single species growing in a particular 
environment evenutally settle on a height which is more or 
less the same for all mature trees in that lot. New trees
will have to struggle for themselves (or die) but the trees
eventually stop growing beyond a certain height. It takes work 
to make a big tree, even if the tall timber has its advantages.
The point is, that water and therefore sap must be pumped (or
rather pulled) from the root zone to the top of the canopy 
before it can be evaporated or used to make more tree or leaves. 
Somehow the leaves need to know how much water is available in
the root zone and pump it up to the leaves about the same rate
as is being transpired<a href="#one"><sup>1</sup></a>. The formalism for expressing how water 
is lifted to the leaves and how the leaf water status may affect
the stomatal resistance constitutes the focus of this scenario. 
</p>

<a name="one"></a>
<p>1. This is only true if the plant itself does not use its 
stored water for transpiration. Plants have the capacity for 
storing water in their leaves, stems and roots and they make 
this water available as needed.  Our model can accommodate a 
water flux to and from storage. In general, this flux is relatively 
small, however. </p>

<a name="potential"></a>
<h2>Water Potential</h2>

<p>Water potential is one of the most difficult concepts to understand.
One reason for the confusion with regard to water potential is that it
has various definitions depending on what water potential one is 
referring to. In addition to this the use of the concept of water 
potential in many different disciplines has generated a babble of 
terminology and some erroneous definitions. Water potential is used to 
describe the water status<a href="#two"><sup>2</sup></a> of the soil and cells within leaves, 
although the processes involved are vastly different. Nevertheless, 
water potential is a useful concept because it can be used to describe
the flow of liquid water through soils and through cell walls in the 
plant, - from higher to lower water potential across a resistance. This
is the essence of the so-called 'K-theory', which forms the basis for
our resistance laws referred to in these scenarios. Thus, it is 
customary to express the flux of liquid water F<sub>w</sub> as a resistance law, 
similar to <a href="#equations">Eqn. 3a</a>, in which a resistance (Z) 
exists across a potential drop. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="ch10_files/10_002.gif" alt="figure 10.1"></p>

<a name="here"></a>
<p>
The units of potential are <strong>bar</strong><a href="#three"><sup>3</sup></a> (or MegaPascals (MPa), where 
1 MPa equals 10 bar) and we will make the units of flux in Watts 
per square metre in order to equate the liquid water flux with the
energy fluxes; (Henceforth, in talking about water (as opposed to
vapor) flux, we will use the symbol Z, which has the units of 
bar (W m<sup>-2</sup>)<sup>-1</sup>, for resistance and the symbol ψ for potential.) The
area unit is understood to be that of the big leaf. The area in 
question is the leaf area. The symbol Z is used instead of r because 
the units are no longer expressed as s m<sup>-1</sup>. We still must convert 
that to a flux per unit surface area. This resistance law is expressed 
by <a href="#equations">Eqn. 10b</a>. 
</p>

<p>Water potential is generally a negative number, with zero 
water potential being the value for pure water in equilibrium 
with its surroundings. Having the units of pressure, water potential
also corresponds to an energy per unit volume. As such, we may
think of this energy as that required to extract a molecule of
water from somewhere, say from a soil particle or from the crevices
between them. </p>



<a name="two"></a>
<p>
2. The extent to which the water can flow or be extracted compared
with a base state ie that of pure water.
</p>


<a name="three"></a>

<p>
3. We are still not sure how the plural works with this unit.
Is it bar or bars?
</p>



<a name="soilwater"></a>
<h2>Soil Water Potential</h2>

<p>As there are many interfaces and pores in soil, the soil water
potential may be appreciably less than zero, except for soil at
field capacity, when ψ<sub>soil</sub>
(which we will call ψ<sub>g</sub> ) is typically 
about --0.1 bar. Field capacity is typically about -0.35 by volume
for clay and loamy soils and about -0.10 by volume for sand. 
Check out Hillel (1982; pp 64 - 73) for a further discussion of 
soil water potential. Since soil water may contain solutes, the 
osmotic pressure component π is typically between -0.1 and -2 bar.
We will ignore this osmotic component of the soil.  
</p>
<p>Water potential is widely used in <strong>soil science and hydrology</strong>.
It is often referred to as the 'suction' (although we would like 
to see someone try to create a suction of -15 bar ! If you think
that you can do it, we'll furnish the straw). Sometimes water 
potential is called <strong>the pressure</strong> (or <strong>hydraulic</strong>)<strong> head</strong> (h), which 
is often expressed in metres rather than in pressure units (the 
conversion from one to the other is water density times gravitational
constant times h, is equal to pressure) as shown in <a href="#equations">Eqn 10a</a>. Note 
that h comprises two components: the soil water potential (often 
referred to as the matric potential, which has no equivalent in the
plant) and a gravitational component H. You may see this water 
potential cited as the <strong>Total Hydraulic Potential</strong>. 
</p>
<p>As the amount of soil water decreases, the air - water 
surface retreats into the crevices between the particles and 
the soil water potential, sometimes referred to as the <strong>soil 
water tension</strong>, becomes more negative; can you physically say
why this is ? Hint: The meteorologists among you may like
to consider the so called Kelvin equation you may have already 
seen in the cloud physics part of physical meteorology and 
make a comparison with the equation given on page 70 in Hillel. 
</p>
<p>Soil water tension is measured by an instrument called a
<strong>tensiometer</strong> (Hillel, 1982; pp 81 - 83). Various parametric
equations exist relating soil water potential to soil water 
content for different types of soils (Cosby <em>et al.</em>, 1984). 
You will often see the term <strong>permanent wilting point</strong> used to 
mean the equivalent soil water content when the volumetric
water content is so low that many agricultural crops will
not recover. Wilting point is more symbolic than a measurable
quantity; it is traditionally assigned the value of -15 bar,
Typical values of soil water content at wilting are 12 
percent by volume for clay or loamy soils and 3 percent for
sand. Of course, the misnomer is that soils do not wilt;
plants wilt. To shed some light on this misuse of the term, 
we will later relate the wilting point to the leaf (rather than
the soil) water potential. 
</p>


<a name="root"></a>
 <h2>Root, Stem and Leaf Water Potentials</h2>

<p>As plants modify the <strong>osmotic potential</strong> across their roots 
water is drawn into the plant which then moves up the stem against
gravity. Since the roots remove water from their immediate 
surroundings, the water content adjacent to the roots is apt to
be lower than that at the same level in the root zone but away
from the roots. This results in a decrease in soil water
potential from the soil around the roots to the surface of the
roots.(This is an important point which we will come back to 
later on.) Water will also flow upward or downward, but in the
former case it can not do so unless the drop in water potential 
with height is greater than the increase in gravimetric potential
with height. Since the change with height in gravimetric 
potential is generally small (about 0.1 bar per metre), we will
henceforth neglect its effect in the resistance equations. The 
resistance to water flow through the ground is known to be a 
function of soil water content, and various parameterizations 
exist relating soil water content to hydraulic conductivity (Cosby
<em>et al.</em>, 1984).
</p>
<p>To enter the roots, the water must flow down a potential
gradient, which is conveniently arranged by the plant by changing
the <strong>osmotic pressure</strong> in the roots. Plant roots tend to be very 
fibrous and fuzzy, thereby having a large surface area (sometimes 
several hundred square metres ! ) over which water and nutrients
within the water can enter the plant. The resistance to the flow 
of water down this potential is thought to be a function of root 
mass, among other things, the larger the root mass the smaller 
the resistance. In the model, this resistance between surrounding
soil and the interior of the root surface depends on the soil 
conductivity, which is, as we have already said, a strong function
of soil water content and on the root mass; modeled crudely as
a function of plant height. (We assume that the bigger the plant 
the greater the root mass.) 
</p>
<p>Once inside the roots, the water flows up through the
stem to the leaves through tiny, tube-like channels called 
<strong>xylem</strong>. This water motion also takes place across another drop 
in water potential. This potential drop is related to 
capillary action and to gradients of osmotic pressure within
the plant. Fundamentally it occurs because of the high surface
tension of water. Briefly, stated, when one molecule of 
water moves, for whatever reason, others are dragged along with
it. For water to be transported to the leaves, the leaf water
potential (specifically the <strong>mesophyll water potential</strong> 
ψ<sub>m</sub> see 
figure 6.1 in scenario 6) must decrease below that of the soil
water potential ψ<sub>g</sub>. 
This relationship between the flux of
water through the plant to the leaves (F<sub>w</sub>) is expressed by
<a href="#equations">Eqn. 10c</a>. 
</p>
<p>The meaning of leaf water potential becomes clearer
when one watches a measurement. Leaf water potential, more 
precisely, the mesophyll potential, was, until fairly 
recently, customarily measured with a pressure chamber 
device, sometimes called a 'pressure bomb'. A piece of a leaf
is inserted in a chamber, which is allowed to undergo an 
increase in pressure. When the pressure reaches the value 
of the leaf water potential, water is driven from the 
intercellular spaces of the leaf and beads of it begin to 
form on the outside of the leaf. A pressure gage, attached
to the housing, is used to record the value of pressure 
at beading. The device is a bit crude and bulky, and the
uncertainty in making a field measurement is on the order 
of about 1 bar.It is also a tedious measurement to make and
the device has recently been replaced by a more sophisticated
apparatus that does not requre the death of a leaf to make 
the measurement. (The significance of this uncertainty will
be elaborated upon in a later scenario)
</p>
<p>There is also a further drop in water potential
between the mesophyll in the leaf and the epidermis,
specifically the guard cells. This potential drop is 
not associated directly with the rate of water flux in 
the plant but may be correlated with the rate of vapor
flux through the leaf cuticle and with the vapor pressure 
deficit between the stomatal cavities and the leaf 
boundary layer. The <strong>epidermal leaf water potential</strong>
ψ<sub>e</sub> may 
constitute a link between the guard cells and the mesophyll 
and hence the water potentials throughout the plant. 
Epidermal leaf water potential is very difficult to measure
directly without sophisticated equipment. Later, we will 
touch on its possible significance.  
</p>

<a name="simulations"></a> <h2>Simulations</h2>

<p><em>Simulation # 1</em></p>

<ul><li>
<p>Run the base case scenario for vegetation but examine the leaf and 
soil water potentials during the day. Do this again for a lower value
of root zone moisture availability (<em>e.g.</em> 0.45).</p></li></ul>


<p><em>Simulation # 2</em></p>

<ul><li><p>Rerun the base case but increase the xylem resistance from 0.05
(current default value) to 0.10 bar (W m-2)-1. Before perfoming this 
simulation, ask yourself what will happen to the leaf water potential
and the stomatal resistance now that you have increased the denominator
in Eqn. 10b, assuming that this equation and Eqn. 7c must both be 
satisfied. See if your intuition holds up. What changes are occurring 
in transpiration and in leaf water potential during the mid morning
and near midday ? (If nothing strikes your attention, try this last 
simulation with a root zone moisture availability of 0.45, recalling 
what happened when you reduced moisture availability to 0.45 in a previous
vegetation scenario.) Do you see a pattern that resembles day 6 in
Figure 10.2? </p></li></ul>
